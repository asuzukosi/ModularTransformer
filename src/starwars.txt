Title: Star Wars: A new hope

STAR WARS
“A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...”
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.
“It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...”
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – MAIN PASSAGEWAY
An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way. THREEPIO Did you hear that? They’ve shut down the main reactor. We’ll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
THREEPIO We’re doomed!
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.
THREEPIO There’ll be no escape for the Princess this time.
Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard

moving around the outside hull of the ship.
THREEPIO What’s that? EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces.
An explosion hits near the robots.
THREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT WASTELAND – DAY
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke’s eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.
LUKE Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust.

Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – MAIN HALLWAY
The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers.
Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
A woman’s hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo’s dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.
THREEPIO Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio’s attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo’s computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.
THREEPIO At last! Where have you been?
Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
THREEPIO They’re heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
THREEPIO Wait a minute, where are you going?
Artoo responds with electronic beeps. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – CORRIDOR
The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain.

VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted? [What have you done with those plans?]
Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
VADER If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer’s throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
VADER Commander, tear this ship apart until you’ve found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – SUBHALLWAY
The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers spots her.
TROOPER There she is! Set for stun!
Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.
TROOPER She’ll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a
prisoner. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – SUBHALLWAY
Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four- man pod.
THREEPIO Hey, you’re not permitted in there. It’s restricted. You’ll
be deactivated for sure..
Artoo beeps something to him.
THREEPIO Don’t call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.
THREEPIO Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I’m not getting in there!
Artoo isn’t happy with Threepio’s stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily.

A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod. THREEPIO I’m going to regret this. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
The safety door snaps shut, and with the thunder of exploding latches the tiny lifepod ejects from the disabled ship. INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER
On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
CHIEF PILOT There goes another one.
CAPTAIN Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have
been short-circuited. INT. LIFEPOD
Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
THREEPIO That’s funny, the damage doesn’t look as bad from out here.
Artoo beeps an assuring response.
THREEPIO Are you sure this things safe? EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.
WOMAN I’ve told you kids to slow down!
Luke pulls up behind a low concrete service station that is all but covered by the shifting desert sands. INT. POWER STATION – DAY Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly. FIXER Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
CAMIE It was just Wormie on another rampage.
Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
LUKE Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
Luke’s surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and

emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
LUKE I didn’t know you were back! When did you get in?
BIGGS Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you’d be here... certainly didn’t expect you to be out working. (laughs) LUKE The Academy didn’t change you much... but you’re back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn’t you get your commission?
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
BIGGS Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... (he salutes) ... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate
landlocked simpletons.
Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.
LUKE I almost forgot. There’s a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!
DEAK Not again! Forget it. EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD – SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
LUKE There they are!
Biggs takes the electrobinoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. Through the electrobinoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
BIGGS That’s no battle, hot shot... they’re just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Camie grabs the electrobinoculars away banging them against the building in the process. Luke grabs them.
LUKE Hey, easy with those...
CAMIE Don’t worry about it, Wormie.
The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
FIXER I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
Luke agrees, although it’s obvious he isn’t sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke’s ineptitude. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – HALLWAY Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of

armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn’t move.
LEIA Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear
you’ve attacked a diplomatic...
VADER Don’t play games with me, Your Highness. You weren’t on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a
restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
VADER You’re a part of the Rebel Alliance ... and a traitor. Take her away!
Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to Vader.
COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
COMMANDER She’ll die before she’ll tell you anything.
VADER Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. They stop and snap to attention.
SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. Vader turns to the Commander.
VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us this time.
COMMANDER Yes, sir. EXT. SPACE
The Imperial Star Destroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT
Jundland, or “No Man’s Land”, where the rugged desert mesas meet

the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-robots kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.
THREEPIO How did I get into this mess? I really don’t know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It’s our lot in life.
Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO I’ve got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What a desolate place this is.
Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him. THREEPIO Where are you going?
A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot. THREEPIO Well, I’m not going that way. It’s much too rocky. This way is much easier.
Artoo counters with a long whistle.
THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there? Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don’t get technical with me.
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What mission? What are you talking about? I’ve had just about enough of you! Go that way! You’ll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.
THREEPIO And don’t let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won’t get it.
Artoo’s reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.
THREEPIO No more adventures. I’m not going that way.
Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains. EXT. TATOOINE – DUNE SEA
Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune: only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.
THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he’ll do no better.
In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his

joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.
THREEPIO Wait, what’s that? A transport! I’m saved!
The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport.
THREEPIO Over here! Help! Please, help!
EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
LUKE (Very animated) ... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak’s trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He
grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic.
BIGGS You ought to take it a little easy Luke. You may be the
hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you’re going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall. LUKE Look who’s talking. Now that you’ve been around those
giant starships you’re beginning to sound like my uncle. You’ve gotten soft in the city...
BIGGS I’ve missed you kid.
LUKE Well, things haven’t been the same since you left, Biggs. It’s been so...quiet.
Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
BIGGS Luke, I didn’t come back just to say goodbye... I shouldn’t
tell you this, but you’re the only one I can trust... and if I don’t
come back, I want somebody to know.
Luke’s eyes are wide with Biggs’ seriousness and loyalty.
LUKE What are you talking about?
BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy. (he whispers) ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we’re going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
LUKE Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
BIGGS Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
LUKE I’m sorry. I’m quiet. (he whispers) Listen how quiet I am. You

can barely hear me...
Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
LUKE You’re crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
BIGGS I know it’s a long shot, but if I don’t find them I’ll do what I can on my own... It’s what we always talked about. Luke, I’m not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side – the side I believe in. LUKE And I’m stuck here...
BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You’ll get your chance to get off this rock.
LUKE Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a
lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they’ve even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
LUKE I know, but he’s got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can’t leave him now.
BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you’re going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle’s work if it’s taken over by the Empire?... You know they’re starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won’t be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
LUKE It couldn’t happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won’t bother with this rock.
BIGGS Things always change.
LUKE I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?
BIGGS No, I’m leaving in the morning...
LUKE Then I guess I won’t see you.
BIGGS Maybe someday... I’ll keep a lookout.
LUKE Well, I’ll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won’t be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that’s for sure... Take care of yourself, you’ll always be the best friend I’ve got.
BIGGS So long, Luke.
Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads back towards the power station. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SUNSET

The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the ominous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path.
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so that only their glowing yellow eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SANDCRAWLER – SUNSET
The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine.
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport. INT. SANDCRAWLER – HOLD AREA
It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber. INT. SANDCRAWLER – PRISON AREA
Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.

THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo! It’s you! It’s you!
A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SANDCRAWLER – SUNSET
The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – DAY
Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
A second trooper picks up a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper.
SECOND TROOPER Look, sir – droids. EXT. TATOOINE – DUNES The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune. INT. SANDCRAWLER
Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
THREEPIO Wake up! Wake up!
Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio’s fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
THREEPIO We’re doomed.
A Jawa starts moving toward them.
THREEPIO Do you think they’ll melt us down?
Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! Will this never end? EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – LARS HOMESTEAD – AFTERNOON
The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be.

Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust- covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each of the robots, he is closely followed by his slump-shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.
BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it
speaks Bocce.
LUKE It looks like we don’t have much of a choice but I’ll remind him. Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader.
OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid.
THREEPIO (quickly) Sir – not in an environment such as this – that’s why I’ve also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the
binary languages of moisture vaporators.
THREEPIO Vaporators! Sir – My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say... OWEN Do you speak Bocce?
THREEPIO Of course I can, sir. It’s like a second language for me... I’m as fluent in Bocce...
OWEN All right; shut up! (turning to Jawa) I’ll take this one. THREEPIO Shutting up, sir.
OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores
are done. Now, come on, get to it!
LUKE All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come
on, Red, let’s go.
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots

start for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro- droid, throwing parts all over the ground. He adjusts the astro-droid’s head plate and it sparks wildly.
LUKE Uncle Owen...
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
OWEN (to the head Jawa) Hey, what’re you trying to push on us? The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder. THREEPIO (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
LUKE Uncle Owen...
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE What about that one?
OWEN (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We’ll take that one.
With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro- droid for Artoo.
LUKE Yeah, take it away.
THREEPIO Uh, I’m quite sure you’ll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I’ve worked with him before. Here he comes.
Owen pays off the whining Jawa and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
LUKE Okay, let’s go.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Now, don’t forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – GARAGE AREA – LATE AFTERNOON
The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low gray chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
THREEPIO Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I’ve got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke’s frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
LUKE It just isn’t fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I’m never gonna get out of

here!
THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help?
Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock!
THREEPIO I don’t think so, sir. I’m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I’m not even sure which planet I’m on.
LUKE Well, if there’s a bright center to the universe, you’re on
the planet that it’s farthest from.
THREEPIO I see, sir.
LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke.
THREEPIO I see, sir Luke.
LUKE (laughing) Just Luke.
THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE Hello.
Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot’s head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body. LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
THREEPIO With all we’ve been through, sometimes I’m amazed we’re in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
THREEPIO That’s how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE Have you been in many battles?
THREEPIO Several, I think. Actually, there’s not much to tell. I’m not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling
stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo’s neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
LUKE Well, my little friend, you’ve got something jammed in here
real good. Were you on a starcruiser or...
The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and

jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke’s mouth hangs open in awe. LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
LUKE What’s this?
Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate.
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. THREEPIO What is what?!? He asked you a question... (pointing to Leia) What is that?
Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope. Help me, Obi- Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
THREEPIO Oh, he says it’s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
LUKE Who is she? She’s beautiful.
THREEPIO I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir – I believe. Our captain was attached to... LUKE Is there more to this recording?
Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo. You’re going to get us in
trouble. It’s all right, you can trust him. He’s our new master.
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says he’s the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it’s a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir,
I don’t know what he’s talking about. Our last master was
Captain Antilles, but with what we’ve been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he’s talking about?
LUKE Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He’s kind of a strange old hermit.
Luke’s gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments. LUKE I wonder who she is. It sounds like she’s in trouble. I’d

better play back the whole thing.
Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn’t really heard what Threepio has been saying.
LUKE H’m? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you’re too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo’s side.
LUKE There you go.
The princess immediately disappears.
LUKE Well, wait a minute. Where’d she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment. THREEPIO What message? The one you’ve just been playing. The one you’re carrying inside your rusty innards!
A women’s voice calls out from another room.
AUNT BERU Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot. LUKE All right, I’ll be right there, Aunt Beru.
THREEPIO I’m sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Luke tosses Artoo’s restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room.
LUKE Well, see what you can do with him. I’ll be right back. THREEPIO (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
Artoo beeps in response.
THREEPIO No, I don’t think he likes you at all.
Artoo beeps.
THREEPIO No, I don’t like you either. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – DINING AREA
Luke’s Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area.
Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain.

LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
OWEN What makes you think that?
LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi.
Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself.
LUKE I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he’s talking about? Well, I wonder if he’s related to Ben.
Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
OWEN That old man’s just a crazy wizard. Tomorrow I want you
to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory
flushed. That’ll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
LUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
OWEN He won’t, I don’t think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
LUKE He knew my father?
OWEN I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the
new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
LUKE Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
Owen’s face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it. OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest?
LUKE Sure, there’re more than enough droids.
OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we’ll make enough on the harvest so I’ll be able
to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy
next year.
Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
OWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke.
LUKE But it’s a whole ‘nother year.
OWEN Look, it’s only one more season.
Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
LUKE Yeah, that’s what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. AUNT BERU Where are you going?
LUKE It looks like I’m going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning
those droids.

Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner.
AUNT BERU Owen, he can’t stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
OWEN I’ll make it up to him next year. I promise.
AUNT BERU Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
OWEN That’s what I’m afraid of. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – GARAGE
Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
LUKE What are you doing hiding there?
Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight. THREEPIO It wasn’t my fault, sir. Please don’t deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he’s faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE Oh, no!
Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro- droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can’t understand their logic at times.
LUKE How could I be so stupid? He’s nowhere in sight. Blast it! THREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn’t we go after him?
LUKE It’s too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We’ll
have to wait until morning.
Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
OWEN Luke, I’m shutting the power down for the night.
LUKE All right, I’ll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. THREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – PLAZA
Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
OWEN Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now! INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – KITCHEN
The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.
OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning?
AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
OWEN Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
AUNT BERU I think so.
OWEN Well, he’d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there’ll be hell to pay! EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT WASTELAND – LUKE’S SPEEDER – DAY
The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland. INT./EXT. LUKE’S SPEEDER – DESERT WASTELAND – TRAVELING – DAY Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment.
LUKE (yelling) How’s that.
Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind- whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don’t see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must
have missed him. Uncle Owen isn’t going to take this very well. THREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He’d probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
THREEPIO Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn’t removed his restraining bolt...
LUKE Wait, there’s something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK MESA – DUNE SEA – COASTLINE – DAY
From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weather-

beaten Sand People shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired.
The Sand People, or Tusken Raiders as they’re sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK MESA – CANYON
The Tusken Raiders approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures’ shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged
bluff. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – FLOOR
The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo. LUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you’re going?
The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.
THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We’ll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don’t talk to me of your mission, either. You’re fortunate he doesn’t blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE Well, come on. It’s getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
THREEPIO If you don’t mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you’ve gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE No, he’s not going to try anything.
Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams.
LUKE What’s wrong with him now?
THREEPIO Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
LUKE Sand People! Or worse! Come on, let’s have a look. Come
on. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – RIDGE – DAY
Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars.

He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer.
LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don’t see any... wait
a second, they’re Sand People all right. I can see one of them now. Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.
The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii – the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – FLOOR – DAY
Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sand People walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. The Sand People ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sand People fleeing in terror.
Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sand People grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him. BEN Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don’t be afraid.
Artoo waddles over to where Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on Luke’s forehead and he begins to come around.
BEN Don’t worry, he’ll be all right.
LUKE What happened?
BEN Rest easy, son, you’ve had a busy day. You’re fortunate

you’re still in one piece.
LUKE Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
BEN The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
LUKE Oh, this little droid! I think he’s searching for his former
master ... I’ve never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi- Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he’s talking about?
Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
BEN Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven’t heard in a long time... a long time.
LUKE I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
BEN Oh, he’s not dead, no... not yet.
LUKE You know him!
BEN Well of course, of course I know him. He’s me! I haven’t gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
LUKE Then the droid does belong to you.
BEN Don’t seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
BEN I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.
LUKE ... Threepio! EXT. TATOOINE – SAND PIT – ROCK MESA – DAY
Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.
Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man’s systems turn on.
THREEPIO Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE Can you stand? We’ve got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
THREEPIO I don’t think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There’s no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I’m done for. Artoo makes a beeping sound.
LUKE No, you’re not. What kind of talk is that?

Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
BEN Quickly, son... they’re on the move. INT. KENOBI’S DWELLING The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio’s arm, as old Ben sits thinking. LUKE No, my father didn’t fight in the wars. He was a navigator on
a spice freighter.
BEN That’s what your uncle told you. He didn’t hold with your
father’s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars?
BEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE I wish I’d known him.
BEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you’ve become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...
Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously. Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
BEN I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to
have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn’t allow
it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-
fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
THREEPIO Sir, if you’ll not be needing me, I’ll close down for awhile. LUKE Sure, go ahead.
Ben hands Luke the saber.
LUKE What is it?
BEN Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling.
BEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over
a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.

Luke hasn’t really been listening.
LUKE How did my father die?
BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the
Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. LUKE The Force?
BEN Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power. It’s an
energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
BEN Now, let’s see if we can’t figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.
LUKE I saw part of the message he was...
Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo’s face.
BEN I seem to have found it.
Luke stops his work as the lovely girl’s image flickers before his eyes. LEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the
Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against
the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father’s request
to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I’m
afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope.
There is a little static and the transmission is cut short. Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.
BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you’re to come with
me to Alderaan.
LUKE (laughing) Alderaan? I’m not going to Alderaan. I’ve got to go home. It’s late, I’m in for it as it is.
BEN I need your help, Luke. I’m getting too old for this sort of
thing. She needs your help.
LUKE I can’t get involved! I’ve got work to do! It’s not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there’s nothing I can do about it right now. It’s such a long way from here.

BEN That’s your uncle talking.
LUKE (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
BEN Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get
a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.
BEN You must do what you feel is right, of course. EXT. SPACE
An Imperial Star Destroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking. TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are
vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They’re more dangerous than you realize.
The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this
battle station!
TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the
Imperial Senate as long as....
Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge’s speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him.
TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I’ve just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
TAGGE That’s impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
TAGGE And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be

a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they’ve
obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
VADER Don’t be too proud of this technological terror
you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
MOTTI Don’t try to frighten us with your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you
conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel’s hidden fort...
Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader’s spell. VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing.
TARKIN Enough of this! Vader, release him!
VADER As you wish.
TARKIN This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us
with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station
is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift
stroke. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies.
LUKE It looks like Sand People did this, all right. Look, here are
gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. It’s just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
BEN They didn’t. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sand People always ride single file to hide
there numbers.
LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.
Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who
they sold them to. And that would lead them back home!
Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps in.
BEN Wait, Luke! It’s too dangerous.
Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning

Sandcrawler. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
The speeder roars up to the homestead. Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place.
LUKE Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him. EXT. SPACE
Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION CORRIDOR
Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia’s face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.
VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of
your hidden Rebel base.
The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead. Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.
BEN There’s nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You’d have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in
the hands of the Empire.
LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard array of low, gray, concrete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing.
BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched

hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined
smile. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardened stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper questions Luke.
TROOPER How long have you had these droids?
LUKE About three or four seasons.
BEN They’re for sale if you want them.
TROOPER Let me see your identification.
Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.
BEN You don’t need to see his identification.
TROOPER We don’t need to see his identification.
BEN These are not the droids you’re looking for.
TROOPER These are not the droids we’re looking for.
BEN He can go about his business.
TROOPER You can go about your business.
BEN (to Luke) Move along.
TROOPER Move along. Move along. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder.
THREEPIO I can’t abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away. LUKE Go on, go on. I can’t understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.
BEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE Do you really think we’re going to find a pilot here that’ll take us to Alderaan?
BEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.
Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
LUKE I’m ready for anything.
THREEPIO Come along, Artoo. INT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – CANTINA
The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled

with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots.
BARTENDER We don’t serve their kind here!
Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn’t quite catch the bartender’s drift.
LUKE What?
BARTENDER Your droids. They’ll have to wait outside. We don’t want them here.
Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
LUKE Listen, why don’t you wait out by the speeder. We don’t want any trouble.
THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir.
Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall-savage-looking creature resembling a huge gray bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold.
Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee.
Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever.
A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove. CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity. HUMAN He doesn’t like you.
LUKE I’m sorry.

HUMAN I don’t like you either
The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer.
HUMAN (continuing) Don’t insult us. You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE I’ll be careful than.
HUMAN You’ll be dead.
The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn’t easy. His three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind Luke.
BEN This little one isn’t worth the effort. Come let me buy
you something...
A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. With a blood- curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. The bartender panics.
BARTENDER No blasters! No blaster!
With astounding agility old Ben’s laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man’s abilities, attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points the the Wookiee.
BEN This is Chewbacca. He’s first- mate on a ship that might suit our needs. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro-droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street.
THREEPIO I don’t like the look of this. INT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – CANTINA
Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old. A mercenary on a starship, he

is simple, sentimental, and cocksure.
HAN Han Solo. I’m captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie
here tells me you’re looking for passage to the Alderaan system. BEN Yes, indeed. If it’s a fast ship.
HAN Fast ship? You’ve never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN Should I have?
HAN It’s the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
Ben reacts to Solo’s stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.
HAN (continuing) I’ve outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk- cruisers, mind you. I’m talking about the big Corellian ships now. She’s fast enough for you, old man. What’s the cargo?
BEN Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
BEN Let’s just say we’d like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. HAN Well, that’s the real trick, isn’t it? And it’s going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! HAN But who’s going to fly it, kid! You?
LUKE You bet I could. I’m not such a bad pilot myself! We don’t
have to sit here and listen...
BEN We haven’t that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN Seventeen, huh!
Han ponders this for a few moments.
HAN Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN Ninety-four.
HAN Looks like somebody’s beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The bartender points to the booth.
TROOPER All right, we’ll check it out.
The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
HAN Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her

ready. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
BEN You’ll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE That’s okay. I’m never coming back to this planet again. INT. MOS EISLEY – CANTINA
As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
GREEDO Going somewhere, Solo?
HAN Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money.
Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him.
GREEDO It’s too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba’s put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I’m lucky I found you first. HAN Yeah, but this time I got the money.
GREEDO If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
HAN I don’t have it with me. Tell Jabba...
GREEDO Jabba’s through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
HAN Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
GREEDO You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. HAN Over my dead body.
GREEDO That’s the idea I’ve been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
HAN Yes, I’ll bet you have.
Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patrons look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves.
HAN Sorry about the mess. EXT. SPACE
Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
VADER Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
TARKIN Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of

persuasion.
VADER What do you mean?
TARKIN I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this
station. (to soldier) Set your course for Princess Leia’s home planet of Alderaan.
TROOPER With pleasure. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds. THREEPIO Lock the door, Artoo.
One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.
TROOPER All right, check that side of the street. It’s secure. Move on to the next door.
The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.
THREEPIO I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don’t know what all this trouble is about, but
I’m sure it must be your fault.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
THREEPIO You watch your language! EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET – ALLEYWAY – USED SPEEDER LOT
Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.
LUKE He says it’s the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they just aren’t in demand.
BEN It will be enough.
Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley.
BEN If the ship’s as fast as he’s boasting, we ought to do well. INT. DOCKING BAY 94 – DAY
Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple

creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth. JABBA Come on out, Solo!
A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.
HAN I’ve been waiting for you, Jabba.
JABBA I expected you would be.
HAN I’m not the type to run.
JABBA (fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven’t you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we’ve been through together. HAN You sent Greedo to blast me.
JABBA (mock surprise) Han, why you’re the best smuggler in the business. You’re too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn’t going to blast you.
HAN I think he thought he was. Next time don’t send one of those twerps. If you’ve got something to say to me, come see me yourself. JABBA Han, Han! If only you hadn’t had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can’t make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It’s not good business.
HAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I’ve got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
JABBA (to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I’m only doing this because you’re the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I’ll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I’ll put a price on your head so large you won’t be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
HAN Jabba, I’ll pay you because it’s my pleasure. EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY – ALLEYWAY
Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94. Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street. Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot. He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter. INT MOS

EISLEY SPACEPORT – DOCKING BAY 94
Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship.
LUKE What a piece of junk.
The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.
HAN She’ll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts, kid. I’ve added
some special modifications myself.
Luke scratches his head. It’s obvious he isn’t sure about all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow.
HAN We’re a little rushed, so if you’ll hurry aboard we’ll get out of here.
The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han
Solo. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
Chewbacca settles into the pilot’s chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship. INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT – DOCKING BAY 94
Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo.
THREEPIO Hello, sir. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature. TROOPER Which way?
The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay. TROOPER All right, men. Load your weapons! INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT – DOCKING BAY 94
The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance.
TROOPER Stop that ship!
Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.
TROOPER Blast ‘em!
Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
HAN Chewie, get us out of here!
The group straps in for take off.

THREEPIO Oh, my. I’d forgotten how much I hate space travel. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREETS
The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han climbs into the pilot’s chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope. EXT. SPACE – PLANET TATOOINE
The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han frantically types information into the ship’s computer. Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.
HAN It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. EXT. SPACE – PLANET TATOOINE
The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet. It is followed by two huge Imperial Star Destroyers. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.
HAN Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they’re going to try to cut us off.
LUKE Why don’t you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
HAN Watch your mouth, kid, or you’re going to find yourself
floating home. We’ll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We’ll lose them! EXT. SPACE – PLANET TATOOINE
Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.
HAN Here’s where the fun begins!
BEN How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN It’ll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-
computer.
The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

LUKE Are you kidding? At the rate they’re gaining...
HAN Traveling through hyperspace isn’t like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that’d end your trip real quick, wouldn’t it?
The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash.
LUKE What’s that flashing?
HAN We’re losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I’m going to make the jump to light speed.
The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace. EXT. SPACE
The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second. EXT. DEATH STAR
Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet.
MOTTI We’ve entered the Alderaan system.
Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her hands are bound.
LEIA Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you
holding Vader’s leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
TARKIN Charming to the last. You don’t know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA I’m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
TARKIN Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
LEIA The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that’ll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station’s destructive
power... on your home planet of Alderaan.

LEIA No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can’t possibly...
TARKIN You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.
TARKIN I grow tired of asking this. So it’ll be the last time. Where
is the Rebel base?
Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan.
LEIA (softly) Dantooine.
Leia lowers her head.
LEIA They’re on Dantooine.
TARKIN There. You see Lord Vader, she can be
reasonable. (addressing Motti) Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
LEIA What?
TARKIN You’re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don’t worry. We will deal with your
Rebel friends soon enough.
LEIA No! INT. DEATH STAR – BLAST CHAMBER
VADER Commence primary ignition.
A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON– CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small “seeker” robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, seems almost faint.
LUKE Are you all right? What’s wrong?
BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I
fear something terrible has happened.
Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes his gaze on Luke.
BEN You’d better get on with your exercises.
Han Solo enters the room.
HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I

told you I’d outrun ‘em.
Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.
HAN Don’t everyone thank me at once.
Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board.
HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-covered arms over his head. THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo.
Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca’s face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.
THREEPIO He made a fair move. Screaming about it won’t help you. HAN (interrupting) Let him have it. It’s not wise to upset a Wookiee. THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN That’s ’cause droids don’t pull people’s arms out of their
socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
THREEPIO I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness.
BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. LUKE You mean it controls your actions?
BEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a “seeker”, a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then to the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke’s face. Luke doesn’t move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a
good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE You don’t believe in the Force, do you?
HAN Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to
make me believe there’s one all-powerful force controlling everything. There’s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. Ben smiles quietly
HAN It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke.
Ben places a large helmet on Luke’s head which covers his eyes. BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can’t even see. How am I supposed to fight?
BEN Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
BEN Stretch out with your feelings.
Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position.
BEN You see, you can do it.
HAN I call it luck.
BEN In my experience, there’s no such thing as luck.
HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That’s something else.
Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel. HAN Looks like we’re coming up on Alderaan.
Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
LUKE You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. BEN That’s good. You have taken your first step into a larger
world. INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.
TARKIN Yes.
OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been

deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
TARKIN She lied! She lied to us!
VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. TARKIN Terminate her... immediately! EXT. HYPERSPACE
The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship. HAN What the...? Aw, we’ve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It’s not on any of the charts. The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.
LUKE What’s going on?
HAN Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
LUKE What do you mean? Where is it?
HAN Thats what I’m trying to tell you, kid. It ain’t there. It’s been totally blown away.
LUKE What? How?
Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down.
BEN Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN The entire starfleet couldn’t destroy the whole planet. It’d take a thousand ships with more fire power than I’ve...
A signal light starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming.
HAN There’s another ship coming in.
LUKE Maybe they know what happened.
BEN It’s an Imperial fighter.
Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.
LUKE It followed us!
BEN No. It’s a short range fighter.
HAN There aren’t any bases around here. Where did it come
from? EXT. SPACE

The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we’re in big trouble.
HAN Not if I can help it. Chewie... jam it’s transmissions.
BEN It’d be as well to let it go. It’s too far out of range.
HAN Not for long... EXT. SPACE
The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca.
BEN A fighter that size couldn’t get this deep into space on its own. LUKE Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
HAN Well, he ain’t going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. EXT. SPACE
The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet. LUKE Look at him. He’s heading for that small moon.
HAN I think I can get him before he gets there... he’s almost in range. The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station.
BEN That’s no moon! It’s a space station.
HAN It’s too big to be a space station.
LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this.
BEN Turn the ship around!
HAN Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.
The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station.
LUKE Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN We’re caught in a tractor beam! It’s pulling us in!
LUKE But there’s gotta be something you can do!
HAN There’s nothin’ I can do about it, kid. I’m in full power. I’m
going to have to shut down. But they’re not going to get me without a fight!

Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.
BEN You can’t win. But there are alternatives to fighting. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – DEATH STAR
As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged. EXT. DEATH STAR – HUGE PORT DOORS The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons.
VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM Clear Bay twenty-three- seven. We are opening the magnetic field. INT. DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY 2037
The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area.
OFFICER To your stations!
OFFICER (to another officer) Come with me. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
Stormtroopers run to their posts. INT. DEATH STAR – HANGAR 2037
A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire. OFFICER Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.
TARKIN Yes.
VOICE (over intercom) We’ve captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It’s markings match those of a
ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
VADER They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. INT. DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY 2037
Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.
VOICE (over intercom) Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
OFFICER (to Vader) There’s no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

VADER Did you find any droids?
OFFICER No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also
have jettisoned.
VADER Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
OFFICER Yes, sir.
VADER I sense something... a presence I haven’t felt since...
Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.
OFFICER Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – HALLWAY
A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker. LUKE Boy, it’s lucky you had these compartments.
HAN I use them for smuggling. I never thought I’d be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I’d never get past the tractor beam.
BEN Leave that to me!
HAN Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
BEN Who’s the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him? Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY
The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.
TROOPER The ship’s all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let’s go.
The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.
HAN’S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard. INT. DEATH STAR – FORWARD BAY – COMMAND OFFICE In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.
GANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two. Why aren’t you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear, indicating his comlink is not

working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.
GANTRY OFFICER Take over. We’ve got a bad transmitter. I’ll see what I can do.
As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone-chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper.
Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet. LUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it’s a wonder the whole station doesn’t know we’re here. HAN Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
THREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir.
Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
BEN Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire
Imperial computer network.
Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.
THREEPIO He says he’s found the main control to the power beam that’s holding the ship here. He’ll try to make the precise
location appear on the monitor.
The computer monitor flashes readouts.
THREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
BEN I don’t think you boys can help. I must go alone.
HAN Whatever you say. I’ve done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE I want to go with you.
BEN Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
LUKE But he can...

BEN They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you ... always!
Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long gray hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement.
HAN Boy you said it, Chewie.
Han looks at Luke.
HAN Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE Ben is a great man.
HAN Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE I didn’t hear you give any ideas...
HAN Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE Who do you think...
Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. Luke goes over to him.
LUKE What is it?
THREEPIO I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir. He says “I found her,” and keeps repeating, “She’s here.”
LUKE Well, who... who has he found?
Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
THREEPIO Princess Leia.
LUKE The princess? She’s here?
HAN Princess?
LUKE Where... where is she?
HAN Princess? What’s going on?
THREEPIO Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three. I’m afraid she’s scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE Oh, no! We’ve got to do something.
HAN What are you talking about?
LUKE The droid belongs to her. She’s the one in the message. We’ve got to help her.
HAN Now, look, don’t get any funny ideas. The old man wants us
to wait right here.
LUKE But he didn’t know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN I’m not going anywhere.
LUKE They’re going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you

said you didn’t want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. LUKE But they’re going to kill her!
HAN Better her than me... LUKE She’s rich. Chewbacca growls.
HAN Rich?
LUKE Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN What?
LUKE Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN I don’t know, I can imagine quite a bit! LUKE You’ll get it!
HAN I better!
LUKE You will...
HAN All right, kid. But you’d better be right about this! Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt. LUKE All right.
HAN What’s your plan?
LUKE Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
LUKE Okay. Now, I’m going to put these on you.
Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
LUKE Okay. Han, you put these on.
Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
HAN Don’t worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
THREEPIO Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we’re discovered here?
LUKE Lock the door!
HAN And hope they don’t have blasters.
THREEPIO That isn’t very reassuring.
Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION AREA – ELEVATOR TUBE
Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant

Wookiee a curious glance.
Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
LUKE I can’t see a thing in this helmet.
A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN HALLWAY
Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him. INT. DEATH STAR – INT. ELEVATOR – DETENTION SECURITY AREA
Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old gray security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
HAN This is not going to work.
LUKE Why didn’t you say so before?
HAN I did say so before! INT. DETENTION AREA
Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio. OFFICER Where are you taking this... thing?
Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up. LUKE Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.
OFFICER I wasn’t notified. I’ll have to clear it.
The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca’s electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han’s laser rifle.
HAN Look out! He’s loose!
LUKE He’s going to pull us all apart.
HAN Go get him!
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial

guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. He quickly checks the computer readout.
HAN We’ve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one- eight-seven. You go get her. I’ll hold them here.
Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the buzzing comlink.
HAN (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation normal. INTERCOM VOICE What happened?
HAN (getting nervous) Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything’s perfectly all right now. We’re fine. We’re all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?
INTERCOM VOICE We’re sending a squad up.
HAN Uh, uh, negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous. INTERCOM VOICE Who is this? What’s your operating number?
Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.
HAN Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We’re going to have company! INT. DEATH STAR – CELL ROW
Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with his laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.
LEIA (finally) Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?
Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.
LUKE What? Oh... the uniform. I’m Luke Skywalker. I’m here
to rescue you.
LEIA You’re who?
LUKE I’m here to rescue you. I’ve got your R2 unit. I’m here with
Ben Kenobi.
LEIA Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
LUKE Come on! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table.
VADER He is here...
TARKIN Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?

VADER A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
TARKIN Surely he must be dead by now.
VADER Don’t underestimate the Force.
TARKIN The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that’s left of their religion. There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.
TARKIN Yes.
INTERCOM VOICE Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.
TARKIN The princess! Put all sections on alert!
VADER Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
TARKIN If you’re right, he must not be allowed to escape.
VADER Escape may not his plan. I must face him alone. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION AREA – HALLWAY
An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door.
HAN Chewie!
Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.
HAN Get behind me! Get behind me!
A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
Han and Chewie fire their laser pistols at them through the smoke and flames. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.
HAN Can’t get out that way.
LEIA Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN (sarcastically) Maybe you’d like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor.
LUKE See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
THREEPIO (over comlink) Yes sir?
LUKE We’ve been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn’t copy! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN BAY GANTRY – CONTROL TOWER
Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter. THREEPIO I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence,

sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.
Someone begins banging on the door.
TROOPER VOICE Open up in there!
THREEPIO Oh, no! INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION CORRIDOR Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor. LUKE There isn’t any other way out.
HAN I can’t hold them off forever! Now what?
LEIA This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn’t you have
a plan for getting out?
HAN (pointing to Luke) He’s the brains, sweetheart.
Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
LUKE Well, I didn’t...
The princess grabs Luke’s gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
HAN What the hell are you doing?
LEIA Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.
HAN Get in there you big furry oaf! I don’t care what you smell! Get in there and don’t worry about it.
Han gives him a big kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.
HAN Wonderful girl! Either I’m going to kill her or I’m beginning to like her. Get in there!
Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smoky cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone. INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM Han tumbles into a large room filled with garbage and muck. Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won’t budge.
HAN (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you’ve discovered! Let’s get out of here! Get away from there...

LUKE No! wait!
Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.
LUKE Will you forget it? I already tried it. It’s magnetically sealed! LEIA Put that thing away! You’re going to get us all killed.
HAN Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under
control until you led us down here. You know, it’s not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA It could be worse...
A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.
HAN It’s worse.
LUKE There’s something alive in here!
HAN That’s your imagination.
LUKE Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? HAN What?
LUKE Help!
Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
HAN Luke! Luke! Luke!
Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat.
LEIA Luke!
Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
LEIA Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE Blast it, will you! My gun’s jammed.
HAN Where?
LUKE Anywhere! Oh!!
Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle.
HAN Luke! Luke!
Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.
LEIA Grab him!

Luke seems to be released by the thing.
LEIA What happened?
LUKE I don’t know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN I’ve got a very bad feeling about this.
Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels.
LUKE The walls are moving!
LEIA Don’t just stand there. Try and brace it with something.
They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn’t look too good.
LUKE Wait a minute!
Luke pulls out his comlink.
LUKE Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he
be? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN GANTRY – COMMAND OFFICE
A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See- Threepio can be heard on Threepio’s hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.
FIRST TROOPER Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to him! Look there!
A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office.
THREEPIO They’re madmen! They’re heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST OFFICER (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard.
The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Come on!
The guard aims a blaster at them.
THREEPIO Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of
my counterpart here. If you don’t mind, I’d like to take him down to maintenance.
TROOPER All right.
The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door. INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.

Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.
LUKE Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash.
HAN Get to the top!
LEIA I can’t
LUKE Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come
in? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL THREEPIO They aren’t here! Something must have happened to them. See if they’ve been captured.
Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot. THREEPIO Hurry! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han’s hand and holds it tightly. She’s terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body.
HAN One thing’s for sure. We’re all going to be a lot thinner! (to Leia) Get on top of it!
LEIA I’m trying! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven’t found them! Where could they be?
Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
THREEPIO Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze. Luke’s comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
Muffled sounds of Luke’s voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly.
THREEPIO Are you there, sir? INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
LUKE Threepio! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
THREEPIO We’ve had some problems...

LUKE (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? INT. DEATH STAR — GARBAGE ROOM.
LUKE Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
LUKE (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from Luke’s comlink.
THREEPIO Listen to them! They’re dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn’t fast enough. It’s all my fault! My poor master!
LUKE (over comlink) Threepio, we’re all right! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the background.
LUKE We’re all right. You did great.
Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number. LUKE Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number ... where are we? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
Threepio looks at the computer panel as Han reads the number.
HAN (over comlink) Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. INT. DEATH STAR – TRACTOR BEAM – POWER GENERATOR TRENCH
Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The clacking sound of a huge switching devices can be heard. The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables. He carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue. INT. DEATH STAR – UNUSED HALLWAY
The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway. Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts. HAN If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to
be able to get out of here.
Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo. LUKE Well, let’s get moving!
Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

HAN (to Chewie) Where are you going?
The dianoga bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim. Han aims his pistol.
LEIA No, wait. They’ll hear!
Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply shakes his head in disgust.
HAN (to Chewie) Come here, you big coward!
Chewie shakes his head “no.”
HAN Chewie! Come here!
LEIA Listen. I don’t know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
HAN Look, Your Worshipfulness, let’s get one thing straight! I
take orders from one person! Me!
LEIA It’s a wonder you’re still alive. (looking at Chewie) Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.
HAN No reward is worth this.
They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor. INT. DEATH STAR – POWER TRENCH
Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him. OFFICER Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
FIRST TROOPER Give me regular reports.
All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
FIRST TROOPER Do you know what’s going on?
SECOND TROOPER Maybe it’s another drill.
Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway.
SECOND TROOPER What was that?
FIRST TROOPER Oh, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers are

milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
HAN (looking at his ship) There she is.
LUKE See-Threepio, do you copy?
THREEPIO (voice) For the moment. Uh, we’re in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE We’re right above you. Stand by.
Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship.
LEIA You came in that thing? You’re braver that I thought.
HAN Nice! Come on!
Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
FIRST TROOPER It’s them! Blast them!
Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
HAN (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship!
LUKE Where are you going? Come back!
Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
LEIA He certainly has courage.
LUKE What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! Luke is furious but doesn’t have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate. Han’s determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY
Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca

turns and starts running the other way also. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY
Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway. INT. DEATH STAR – CENTRAL CORE SHAFT
Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back.
LUKE (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn.
Blasts from the stormtroopers’ laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
LEIA There’s no lock!
Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
LUKE That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA Quick, we’ve got to get across. Find the control that extends
the bridge.
LUKE Oh, I think I just blasted it.
Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
LEIA They’re coming through!
Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troopers appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest.
Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke’s laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
LUKE Here, hold this.
Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. It has a grappler hook on it.
A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia.

As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well. Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops.
LEIA Here they come!
Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.
LEIA For luck!
Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway. INT. DEATH STAR – NARROW PASSAGEWAY
Ben hides in the shadows of a narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to make sure they’re gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp.
THREEPIO Where could they be?
Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response. INT. DEATH STAR – CORRIDOR – BLAST SHIELDS DOOR
Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail.
TROOPER Close the blast doors!
At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut. TROOPER Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY
Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader

lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward. VADER I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.
Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance. VADER When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master. BEN Only a master of evil, Darth.
The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his head.
Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi’s blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.
VADER Your powers are weak, old man.
BEN You can’t win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become
more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY
Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
HAN Didn’t we just leave this party?
Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.
HAN What kept you?
LEIA We ran into some old friends.
LUKE Is the ship all right?
HAN Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group’s vantage point.
LUKE Look!
Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader

emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay. INT. DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY
Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star’s Imperial docking bay.
THREEPIO Come on, Artoo, we’re going!
Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and the Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The troops rush toward the battling knights.
HAN Now’s our chance! Go!
They start for the Millennium Falcon.
Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader takes advantage of Ben’s momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.
The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword from Vader’s then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face.
Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben’s cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. Vader is puzzled at Ben’s disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship.
Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out. LUKE No!
The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him. The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.
HAN (to Luke) Come on!
LEIA Come on! Luke, its too late!
HAN Blast the door! Kid!
Luke fires his laser pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them... shutting Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumples to the floor.

BEN’S VOICE Run, Luke! Run!
Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. The dull thud of laserbolts can be heard bouncing off the outside of the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.
HAN I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!
Chewbacca growls in agreement. EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She sits down beside him. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Solo spots approaching enemy ships.
HAN (to Chewie) We’re coming up on the sentry ships. Hold ‘em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.
LUKE I can’t believe he’s gone.
Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.
LEIA There wasn’t anything you could have done.
Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the princess. HAN (to Luke) Come on, buddy, we’re not out of this yet! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS – COCKPIT
Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – HOLD AREA
Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads for the cockpit. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS – COCKPIT Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large rotating turrets on either side of the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – SOLO’S GUNPORT
Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.
HAN (to Luke) You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp! INT. MILLENNIUM

FALCON – GUNPORTS – COCKPIT
Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – SOLO’S GUNPORT – COCKPIT
Computer graphic readouts form on Solo’s target screen, as Han reaches for controls. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT – COCKPIT

Luke fires at an unseen fighter.
LUKE They’re coming in too fast! EXT. SPACE – MILLENNIUM FALCON, TIE FIGHTERS
Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – CHEWBACCA
The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the cockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia. EXT. TIE FIGHTER – SPACE Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame, firing on the pirate starship. EXT. SPACE – TIE FIGHTERS
The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the

pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – MAIN PASSAGEWAY
A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips.
THREEPIO Oooh! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT – GUNPORTS
Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the ship’s controls.
LEIA We’ve lost lateral controls.
HAN Don’t worry, she’ll hold together.
An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship’s control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.
HAN (to ship) You hear me, baby? Hold together!
Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT
Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter with his laser cannon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT
Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighters. EXT. SPACE

A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs victoriously. EXT. SPACE
Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular direct hit.
LUKE Got him! I got him!
Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully returns. HAN Great kid! Don’t get cocky.
Han turns back to his laser cannon. EXT. SPACE

Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports.
LEIA There are still two more of them out there! EXT. SPACE A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Luke and Han look into their respective projected target screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo’s port, and Han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke’s port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face. EXT. SPACE
The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke’s projected screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by enemy fire. EXT. SPACE – TIE FIGHTER
The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, firing upon the Falcon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT
Solo swivels behind his laser cannon, his aim describing the arc of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo’s laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments.
LUKE (laughing) That’s it! We did it!
The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.
LEIA We did it! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – PASSAGEWAY Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires.
THREEPIO Help! I think I’m melting! (to Artoo) This is all your fault. Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response. EXT. SPACE – MILLENNIUM FALCON
The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically through space. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.
TARKIN Are they away?
VADER They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
TARKIN You’re sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I’m taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. INT.

MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage. Leia is seated near Han.
HAN Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA That doesn’t sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It’s the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA Their tracking us!
HAN Not this ship, sister.
Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.
LEIA At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN What’s so important? What’s he carrying?
LEIA The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope
that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It’s
not over yet!
HAN It is for me, sister! Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution, and I’m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the money!
LEIA You needn’t worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that’s what you’ll receive!
She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, passes Luke coming in.
LEIA Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
LUKE I care!
Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space.
LUKE So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN I’m trying not to, kid!
LUKE (under his breath) Good...
HAN Still, she’s got a lot of spirit. I don’t know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE No!
Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at young Luke’s jealousy. EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN
The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons. EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

The pirateship soars over the dense jungle. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST
An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside. He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – JUNGLE TEMPLE
Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops.
Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder. INT. MASSASSI – MAIN HANGAR DECK
The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her. WILLARD (holding Leia) You’re safe! We had feared the worst.
Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.
WILLARD When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
LEIA We don’t have time for our sorrows, commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. (looking pointedly at Han) It’s the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. EXT. SPACE
The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Darth Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer the call.
TARKIN Yes.
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE We are approaching the
planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We
are preparing to orbit the planet. EXT. YAVIN – JUNGLE
A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green. INT. MASSASSI – WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA
Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. The low- ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is

saying. Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back.
DODONNA The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna.
GOLD LEADER Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
DODONNA Well, the Empire doesn’t consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they’d have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left.
DODONNA The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
A murmur of disbelief runs through the room.
DODONNA Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray- shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes.
Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old.
WEDGE That’s impossible, even for a computer.
LUKE It’s not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T- sixteen back home. They’re not much bigger than two meters. DODONNA Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
The group rises and begins to leave. EXT. SPACE.
The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon. INT. DEATH STAR
Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it’s position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon.
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE Orbiting the planet at
maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range
in thirty minutes.
VADER This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of

Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – MAIN HANGAR DECK
Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.
MAN’S VOICE (over loudspeaker) All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots’ preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend’s departure.
LUKE So... you got your reward and you’re just leaving then?
HAN That’s right, yeah! I got some old debts I’ve got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn’t, you don’t think I’d be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don’t you come with us? You’re pretty good in a fight. I could use you.
LUKE (getting angry) Come on! Why don’t you take a look around? You know what’s about to happen, what they’re up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You’re turning your back on them. HAN What good’s a reward if you ain’t around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station ain’t my idea of courage. It’s more like suicide.
LUKE All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that’s
what you’re best at, isn’t it?
Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.
HAN Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off.
Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,
HAN What’re you lookin’ at? I know what I’m doing. INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK – LUKE’S SHIP
Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
LEIA What’s wrong?
LUKE Oh, it’s Han! I don’t know, I really thought he’d change
his mind.
LEIA He’s got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. LUKE I only wish Ben were here.
Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off.
As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs

his arm.
BIGGS Luke! I don’t believe it! How’d you get here... are you going out with us?!
LUKE Biggs! Of course, I’ll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
RED LEADER Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
BIGGS Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter. RED LEADER I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was a great pilot. You’ll do all right. If you’ve got half of your father’s
skill, you’ll do better than all right.
LUKE Thank you, sir. I’ll try.
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
BIGGS I’ve got to get aboard. Listen, you’ll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?
LUKE I told you I’d make it someday, Biggs.
BIGGS (going off) You did, all right. It’s going to be like old times Luke. We’re a couple of shooting stars that’ll never be stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for his ship.
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter. CHIEF This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
LUKE Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. (to Artoo) You okay, Artoo?
The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine.
Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke’s X-wing. It’s an emotion-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye.
CHIEF Okay, easy she goes!
THREEPIO Hang on tight, Artoo, you’ve got to come back.
Artoo beeps in agreement.
THREEPIO You wouldn’t want my life to get boring, would you?

Artoo whistles his reply.
All final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments.
The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
BEN’S VOICE Luke, the Force will be with you.
Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – JUNGLE
All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and disappear into the morning cloud cover. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – WAR ROOM
The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appears around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills the war room.
MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE Stand-by alert. Death
Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen
minutes. EXT. SPACE
The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame. EXT. SPACE – ANOTHER ANGLE
Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly pull away. INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP – COCKPIT
Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, looking to each side at his wing men.
RED LEADER All wings report in. INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT
One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.

Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted slightly.
RED LEADER (over headset) Switch your deflectors on. INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT
RED LEADER (over headset) Double front! EXT. SPACE
The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna is built into the surface on one side. INT. WEDGE’S COCKPIT
Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome spectacle. WEDGE Look at the size of that thing!
RED LEADER (over headset) Cut the chatter, Red Two. INT. RED LEADER’S COCKPIT
RED LEADER Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! EXT. SPACE
As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half of the deadly space

station is in shadow and this area sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a city at night as seen from a weather satellite. INT. GOLD LEADER’S COCKPIT
GOLD LEADER Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
RED LEADER (over headset) I copy, Gold Leader.
GOLD LEADER We’re starting for the target shaft now. INT. RED LEADER’S COCKPIT
Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in the background. He moves his computer targeting device into position. RED LEADER We’re in position. I’m going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. EXT. SPACE
Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across the dark gray expanse of the huge station. INT. DEATH STAR
Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate the huge guns into position as the crew adjust their targeting devices.
EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and fires. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – WAR ROOM
Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom. Threepio is at her side.

X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star. INT. LUKE’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT
Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit window. LUKE This is Red Five! I’m going in! EXT. SPACE

Luke’s X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak from Luke’s weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on the dim surface. INT. LUKE’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT
Terror crosses Luke’s face as he realizes he won’t be able to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.
BIGGS (over headset) Luke, pull up! EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR
Luke’s ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges of his wings slightly scorched. INT. BIGGS’ COCKPIT
BIGGS Are you all right? INT. LUKE’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT
Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.
LUKE I got a little cooked, but I’m okay. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star’s surface with laserbolts. INT. DEATH STAR
Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble. Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes up to him.
ASTRO-OFFICER We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they’re so small they’re evading our turbo-lasers!
VADER We’ll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. INT. DEATH STAR
Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers’ head gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming noise of the monstrous weapon. One trooper bangs his helmet with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing. INT. READ LEADER’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.
RED LEADER Luke, let me know when you’re going in. INT. LUKE’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
The Red Leader’s X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose down and starts his attack dive.
LUKE I’m on my way in now...
RED LEADER Watch yourself! There’s a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.

LUKE I’m on it. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon and down onto the dim gray surface. EXT. LUKE’S X-WING TRAVELING A shot hurls from Luke’s guns. Laserbolts streak toward the onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on the surface. INT. LUKE’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit windows as a big smile sweeps across Luke’s face at the success of his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from the surface towards the heavens. INT. DEATH STAR
The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of explosions. INT. BIGGS’ COCKPIT – TRAVELING
Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides. INT. DEATH STAR Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – WAR ROOM
Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working over a screen speaks into his headset.
CONTROL OFFICER Squad leaders, we’ve picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way. INT. LUKE’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching Imperial fighters.
LUKE My scope’s negative. I don’t see anything. INT. RED LEADER’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
The Death Star’s surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches the sky for the Imperial fighter. Flak pounds at his ship.
RED LEADER Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they’ll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon, four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters. Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan with the remaining two TIE ships. INT. BIGGS’ COCKPIT – TRAVELING
Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The horizon in the background twists around as he peels off, hoping to lose the Imperial fighter. INT. RED LEADER’S COCKPIT
RED LEADER Biggs! You’ve picked one up... watch it!
BIGGS I can’t see it! Where is he?! EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several laserbolts at Biggs, but misses. INT. BIGGS’ COCKPIT – TRAVELING

The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.
THREEPIO Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! (to mechanic) You can repair him, can’t you?
TECHNICIAN We’ll get to work on him right away.
THREEPIO You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I’ll gladly donate them.
LUKE He’ll be all right. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – MAIN THRONE ROOM
Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From one side of the temple marches a shined- up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She rises and places a gold medallion around Han’s neck. He winks at her. She then

repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness.
FADE OUT.
END CREDITS OVER STARS.




Title: Star Wars: Empire strikes back
STAR WARS
“A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...”
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.
“It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...”
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – MAIN PASSAGEWAY
An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way. THREEPIO Did you hear that? They’ve shut down the main reactor. We’ll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
THREEPIO We’re doomed!
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.
THREEPIO There’ll be no escape for the Princess this time.
Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard

moving around the outside hull of the ship.
THREEPIO What’s that? EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces.
An explosion hits near the robots.
THREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT WASTELAND – DAY
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke’s eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.
LUKE Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust.

Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – MAIN HALLWAY
The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers.
Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
A woman’s hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo’s dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.
THREEPIO Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio’s attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo’s computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.
THREEPIO At last! Where have you been?
Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
THREEPIO They’re heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
THREEPIO Wait a minute, where are you going?
Artoo responds with electronic beeps. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – CORRIDOR
The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain.

VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted? [What have you done with those plans?]
Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
VADER If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer’s throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
VADER Commander, tear this ship apart until you’ve found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – SUBHALLWAY
The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers spots her.
TROOPER There she is! Set for stun!
Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.
TROOPER She’ll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a
prisoner. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – SUBHALLWAY
Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four- man pod.
THREEPIO Hey, you’re not permitted in there. It’s restricted. You’ll
be deactivated for sure..
Artoo beeps something to him.
THREEPIO Don’t call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.
THREEPIO Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I’m not getting in there!
Artoo isn’t happy with Threepio’s stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily.

A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod. THREEPIO I’m going to regret this. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
The safety door snaps shut, and with the thunder of exploding latches the tiny lifepod ejects from the disabled ship. INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER
On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
CHIEF PILOT There goes another one.
CAPTAIN Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have
been short-circuited. INT. LIFEPOD
Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
THREEPIO That’s funny, the damage doesn’t look as bad from out here.
Artoo beeps an assuring response.
THREEPIO Are you sure this things safe? EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.
WOMAN I’ve told you kids to slow down!
Luke pulls up behind a low concrete service station that is all but covered by the shifting desert sands. INT. POWER STATION – DAY Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly. FIXER Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
CAMIE It was just Wormie on another rampage.
Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
LUKE Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
Luke’s surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and

emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
LUKE I didn’t know you were back! When did you get in?
BIGGS Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you’d be here... certainly didn’t expect you to be out working. (laughs) LUKE The Academy didn’t change you much... but you’re back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn’t you get your commission?
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
BIGGS Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... (he salutes) ... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate
landlocked simpletons.
Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.
LUKE I almost forgot. There’s a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!
DEAK Not again! Forget it. EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD – SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
LUKE There they are!
Biggs takes the electrobinoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. Through the electrobinoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
BIGGS That’s no battle, hot shot... they’re just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Camie grabs the electrobinoculars away banging them against the building in the process. Luke grabs them.
LUKE Hey, easy with those...
CAMIE Don’t worry about it, Wormie.
The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
FIXER I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
Luke agrees, although it’s obvious he isn’t sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke’s ineptitude. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – HALLWAY Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of

armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn’t move.
LEIA Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear
you’ve attacked a diplomatic...
VADER Don’t play games with me, Your Highness. You weren’t on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a
restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
LEIA I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
VADER You’re a part of the Rebel Alliance ... and a traitor. Take her away!
Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to Vader.
COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
COMMANDER She’ll die before she’ll tell you anything.
VADER Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. They stop and snap to attention.
SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. Vader turns to the Commander.
VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us this time.
COMMANDER Yes, sir. EXT. SPACE
The Imperial Star Destroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT
Jundland, or “No Man’s Land”, where the rugged desert mesas meet

the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-robots kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.
THREEPIO How did I get into this mess? I really don’t know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It’s our lot in life.
Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO I’ve got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What a desolate place this is.
Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him. THREEPIO Where are you going?
A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot. THREEPIO Well, I’m not going that way. It’s much too rocky. This way is much easier.
Artoo counters with a long whistle.
THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there? Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don’t get technical with me.
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What mission? What are you talking about? I’ve had just about enough of you! Go that way! You’ll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.
THREEPIO And don’t let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won’t get it.
Artoo’s reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.
THREEPIO No more adventures. I’m not going that way.
Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains. EXT. TATOOINE – DUNE SEA
Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune: only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.
THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he’ll do no better.
In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his

joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.
THREEPIO Wait, what’s that? A transport! I’m saved!
The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport.
THREEPIO Over here! Help! Please, help!
EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
LUKE (Very animated) ... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak’s trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He
grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic.
BIGGS You ought to take it a little easy Luke. You may be the
hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you’re going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall. LUKE Look who’s talking. Now that you’ve been around those
giant starships you’re beginning to sound like my uncle. You’ve gotten soft in the city...
BIGGS I’ve missed you kid.
LUKE Well, things haven’t been the same since you left, Biggs. It’s been so...quiet.
Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
BIGGS Luke, I didn’t come back just to say goodbye... I shouldn’t
tell you this, but you’re the only one I can trust... and if I don’t
come back, I want somebody to know.
Luke’s eyes are wide with Biggs’ seriousness and loyalty.
LUKE What are you talking about?
BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy. (he whispers) ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we’re going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
LUKE Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
BIGGS Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
LUKE I’m sorry. I’m quiet. (he whispers) Listen how quiet I am. You

can barely hear me...
Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
LUKE You’re crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
BIGGS I know it’s a long shot, but if I don’t find them I’ll do what I can on my own... It’s what we always talked about. Luke, I’m not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side – the side I believe in. LUKE And I’m stuck here...
BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You’ll get your chance to get off this rock.
LUKE Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a
lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they’ve even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
LUKE I know, but he’s got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can’t leave him now.
BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you’re going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle’s work if it’s taken over by the Empire?... You know they’re starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won’t be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
LUKE It couldn’t happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won’t bother with this rock.
BIGGS Things always change.
LUKE I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?
BIGGS No, I’m leaving in the morning...
LUKE Then I guess I won’t see you.
BIGGS Maybe someday... I’ll keep a lookout.
LUKE Well, I’ll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won’t be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that’s for sure... Take care of yourself, you’ll always be the best friend I’ve got.
BIGGS So long, Luke.
Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads back towards the power station. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SUNSET

The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the ominous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path.
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so that only their glowing yellow eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SANDCRAWLER – SUNSET
The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine.
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport. INT. SANDCRAWLER – HOLD AREA
It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber. INT. SANDCRAWLER – PRISON AREA
Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.

THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo! It’s you! It’s you!
A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SANDCRAWLER – SUNSET
The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – DAY
Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
A second trooper picks up a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper.
SECOND TROOPER Look, sir – droids. EXT. TATOOINE – DUNES The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune. INT. SANDCRAWLER
Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
THREEPIO Wake up! Wake up!
Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio’s fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
THREEPIO We’re doomed.
A Jawa starts moving toward them.
THREEPIO Do you think they’ll melt us down?
Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! Will this never end? EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – LARS HOMESTEAD – AFTERNOON
The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be.

Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust- covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each of the robots, he is closely followed by his slump-shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.
BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it
speaks Bocce.
LUKE It looks like we don’t have much of a choice but I’ll remind him. Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader.
OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid.
THREEPIO (quickly) Sir – not in an environment such as this – that’s why I’ve also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the
binary languages of moisture vaporators.
THREEPIO Vaporators! Sir – My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say... OWEN Do you speak Bocce?
THREEPIO Of course I can, sir. It’s like a second language for me... I’m as fluent in Bocce...
OWEN All right; shut up! (turning to Jawa) I’ll take this one. THREEPIO Shutting up, sir.
OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores
are done. Now, come on, get to it!
LUKE All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come
on, Red, let’s go.
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots

start for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro- droid, throwing parts all over the ground. He adjusts the astro-droid’s head plate and it sparks wildly.
LUKE Uncle Owen...
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
OWEN (to the head Jawa) Hey, what’re you trying to push on us? The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder. THREEPIO (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
LUKE Uncle Owen...
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE What about that one?
OWEN (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We’ll take that one.
With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro- droid for Artoo.
LUKE Yeah, take it away.
THREEPIO Uh, I’m quite sure you’ll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I’ve worked with him before. Here he comes.
Owen pays off the whining Jawa and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
LUKE Okay, let’s go.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Now, don’t forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – GARAGE AREA – LATE AFTERNOON
The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low gray chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
THREEPIO Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I’ve got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke’s frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
LUKE It just isn’t fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I’m never gonna get out of

here!
THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help?
Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock!
THREEPIO I don’t think so, sir. I’m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I’m not even sure which planet I’m on.
LUKE Well, if there’s a bright center to the universe, you’re on
the planet that it’s farthest from.
THREEPIO I see, sir.
LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke.
THREEPIO I see, sir Luke.
LUKE (laughing) Just Luke.
THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
LUKE Hello.
Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot’s head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body. LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
THREEPIO With all we’ve been through, sometimes I’m amazed we’re in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
THREEPIO That’s how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
LUKE Have you been in many battles?
THREEPIO Several, I think. Actually, there’s not much to tell. I’m not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling
stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo’s neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
LUKE Well, my little friend, you’ve got something jammed in here
real good. Were you on a starcruiser or...
The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and

jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke’s mouth hangs open in awe. LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
LUKE What’s this?
Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate.
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. THREEPIO What is what?!? He asked you a question... (pointing to Leia) What is that?
Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope. Help me, Obi- Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
THREEPIO Oh, he says it’s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
LUKE Who is she? She’s beautiful.
THREEPIO I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.
LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir – I believe. Our captain was attached to... LUKE Is there more to this recording?
Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo. You’re going to get us in
trouble. It’s all right, you can trust him. He’s our new master.
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says he’s the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it’s a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir,
I don’t know what he’s talking about. Our last master was
Captain Antilles, but with what we’ve been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he’s talking about?
LUKE Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He’s kind of a strange old hermit.
Luke’s gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments. LUKE I wonder who she is. It sounds like she’s in trouble. I’d

better play back the whole thing.
Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn’t really heard what Threepio has been saying.
LUKE H’m? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you’re too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo’s side.
LUKE There you go.
The princess immediately disappears.
LUKE Well, wait a minute. Where’d she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment. THREEPIO What message? The one you’ve just been playing. The one you’re carrying inside your rusty innards!
A women’s voice calls out from another room.
AUNT BERU Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot. LUKE All right, I’ll be right there, Aunt Beru.
THREEPIO I’m sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Luke tosses Artoo’s restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room.
LUKE Well, see what you can do with him. I’ll be right back. THREEPIO (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
Artoo beeps in response.
THREEPIO No, I don’t think he likes you at all.
Artoo beeps.
THREEPIO No, I don’t like you either. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – DINING AREA
Luke’s Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area.
Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain.

LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
OWEN What makes you think that?
LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi.
Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself.
LUKE I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he’s talking about? Well, I wonder if he’s related to Ben.
Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
OWEN That old man’s just a crazy wizard. Tomorrow I want you
to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory
flushed. That’ll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
LUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
OWEN He won’t, I don’t think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
LUKE He knew my father?
OWEN I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the
new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
LUKE Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
Owen’s face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it. OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest?
LUKE Sure, there’re more than enough droids.
OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we’ll make enough on the harvest so I’ll be able
to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy
next year.
Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
OWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke.
LUKE But it’s a whole ‘nother year.
OWEN Look, it’s only one more season.
Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
LUKE Yeah, that’s what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. AUNT BERU Where are you going?
LUKE It looks like I’m going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning
those droids.

Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner.
AUNT BERU Owen, he can’t stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
OWEN I’ll make it up to him next year. I promise.
AUNT BERU Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
OWEN That’s what I’m afraid of. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – GARAGE
Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
LUKE What are you doing hiding there?
Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight. THREEPIO It wasn’t my fault, sir. Please don’t deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he’s faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
LUKE Oh, no!
Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro- droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can’t understand their logic at times.
LUKE How could I be so stupid? He’s nowhere in sight. Blast it! THREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn’t we go after him?
LUKE It’s too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We’ll
have to wait until morning.
Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
OWEN Luke, I’m shutting the power down for the night.
LUKE All right, I’ll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. THREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – PLAZA
Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
OWEN Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now! INT. LARS HOMESTEAD – KITCHEN
The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.
OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning?
AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
OWEN Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
AUNT BERU I think so.
OWEN Well, he’d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there’ll be hell to pay! EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT WASTELAND – LUKE’S SPEEDER – DAY
The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland. INT./EXT. LUKE’S SPEEDER – DESERT WASTELAND – TRAVELING – DAY Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment.
LUKE (yelling) How’s that.
Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind- whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don’t see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must
have missed him. Uncle Owen isn’t going to take this very well. THREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
LUKE (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He’d probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
THREEPIO Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn’t removed his restraining bolt...
LUKE Wait, there’s something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK MESA – DUNE SEA – COASTLINE – DAY
From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weather-

beaten Sand People shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired.
The Sand People, or Tusken Raiders as they’re sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK MESA – CANYON
The Tusken Raiders approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures’ shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged
bluff. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – FLOOR
The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo. LUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you’re going?
The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.
THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We’ll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don’t talk to me of your mission, either. You’re fortunate he doesn’t blast you into a million pieces right here.
LUKE Well, come on. It’s getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
THREEPIO If you don’t mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you’ve gotten him back to your workshop.
LUKE No, he’s not going to try anything.
Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams.
LUKE What’s wrong with him now?
THREEPIO Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
LUKE Sand People! Or worse! Come on, let’s have a look. Come
on. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – RIDGE – DAY
Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars.

He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer.
LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don’t see any... wait
a second, they’re Sand People all right. I can see one of them now. Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.
The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii – the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – FLOOR – DAY
Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sand People walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. The Sand People ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sand People fleeing in terror.
Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sand People grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him. BEN Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don’t be afraid.
Artoo waddles over to where Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on Luke’s forehead and he begins to come around.
BEN Don’t worry, he’ll be all right.
LUKE What happened?
BEN Rest easy, son, you’ve had a busy day. You’re fortunate

you’re still in one piece.
LUKE Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
BEN The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
LUKE Oh, this little droid! I think he’s searching for his former
master ... I’ve never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi- Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he’s talking about?
Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
BEN Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven’t heard in a long time... a long time.
LUKE I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
BEN Oh, he’s not dead, no... not yet.
LUKE You know him!
BEN Well of course, of course I know him. He’s me! I haven’t gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
LUKE Then the droid does belong to you.
BEN Don’t seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
BEN I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.
LUKE ... Threepio! EXT. TATOOINE – SAND PIT – ROCK MESA – DAY
Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.
Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man’s systems turn on.
THREEPIO Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
LUKE Can you stand? We’ve got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
THREEPIO I don’t think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There’s no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I’m done for. Artoo makes a beeping sound.
LUKE No, you’re not. What kind of talk is that?

Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
BEN Quickly, son... they’re on the move. INT. KENOBI’S DWELLING The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio’s arm, as old Ben sits thinking. LUKE No, my father didn’t fight in the wars. He was a navigator on
a spice freighter.
BEN That’s what your uncle told you. He didn’t hold with your
father’s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars?
BEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
LUKE I wish I’d known him.
BEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you’ve become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...
Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously. Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
BEN I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to
have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn’t allow
it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-
fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
THREEPIO Sir, if you’ll not be needing me, I’ll close down for awhile. LUKE Sure, go ahead.
Ben hands Luke the saber.
LUKE What is it?
BEN Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling.
BEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over
a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.

Luke hasn’t really been listening.
LUKE How did my father die?
BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the
Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. LUKE The Force?
BEN Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power. It’s an
energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
BEN Now, let’s see if we can’t figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.
LUKE I saw part of the message he was...
Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo’s face.
BEN I seem to have found it.
Luke stops his work as the lovely girl’s image flickers before his eyes. LEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the
Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against
the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father’s request
to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I’m
afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope.
There is a little static and the transmission is cut short. Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.
BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you’re to come with
me to Alderaan.
LUKE (laughing) Alderaan? I’m not going to Alderaan. I’ve got to go home. It’s late, I’m in for it as it is.
BEN I need your help, Luke. I’m getting too old for this sort of
thing. She needs your help.
LUKE I can’t get involved! I’ve got work to do! It’s not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there’s nothing I can do about it right now. It’s such a long way from here.

BEN That’s your uncle talking.
LUKE (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
BEN Learn about the Force, Luke.
LUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get
a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.
BEN You must do what you feel is right, of course. EXT. SPACE
An Imperial Star Destroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking. TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are
vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They’re more dangerous than you realize.
The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this
battle station!
TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the
Imperial Senate as long as....
Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge’s speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him.
TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I’ve just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
TAGGE That’s impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
TAGGE And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be

a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they’ve
obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
VADER Don’t be too proud of this technological terror
you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
MOTTI Don’t try to frighten us with your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you
conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel’s hidden fort...
Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader’s spell. VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing.
TARKIN Enough of this! Vader, release him!
VADER As you wish.
TARKIN This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us
with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station
is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift
stroke. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies.
LUKE It looks like Sand People did this, all right. Look, here are
gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. It’s just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
BEN They didn’t. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sand People always ride single file to hide
there numbers.
LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.
Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who
they sold them to. And that would lead them back home!
Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps in.
BEN Wait, Luke! It’s too dangerous.
Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning

Sandcrawler. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
The speeder roars up to the homestead. Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place.
LUKE Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him. EXT. SPACE
Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION CORRIDOR
Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia’s face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.
VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of
your hidden Rebel base.
The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead. Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.
BEN There’s nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You’d have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in
the hands of the Empire.
LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard array of low, gray, concrete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing.
BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched

hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined
smile. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardened stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper questions Luke.
TROOPER How long have you had these droids?
LUKE About three or four seasons.
BEN They’re for sale if you want them.
TROOPER Let me see your identification.
Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.
BEN You don’t need to see his identification.
TROOPER We don’t need to see his identification.
BEN These are not the droids you’re looking for.
TROOPER These are not the droids we’re looking for.
BEN He can go about his business.
TROOPER You can go about your business.
BEN (to Luke) Move along.
TROOPER Move along. Move along. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder.
THREEPIO I can’t abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away. LUKE Go on, go on. I can’t understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.
BEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE Do you really think we’re going to find a pilot here that’ll take us to Alderaan?
BEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.
Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
LUKE I’m ready for anything.
THREEPIO Come along, Artoo. INT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – CANTINA
The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled

with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots.
BARTENDER We don’t serve their kind here!
Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn’t quite catch the bartender’s drift.
LUKE What?
BARTENDER Your droids. They’ll have to wait outside. We don’t want them here.
Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
LUKE Listen, why don’t you wait out by the speeder. We don’t want any trouble.
THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir.
Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall-savage-looking creature resembling a huge gray bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold.
Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee.
Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever.
A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove. CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity. HUMAN He doesn’t like you.
LUKE I’m sorry.

HUMAN I don’t like you either
The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer.
HUMAN (continuing) Don’t insult us. You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE I’ll be careful than.
HUMAN You’ll be dead.
The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn’t easy. His three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind Luke.
BEN This little one isn’t worth the effort. Come let me buy
you something...
A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. With a blood- curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. The bartender panics.
BARTENDER No blasters! No blaster!
With astounding agility old Ben’s laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man’s abilities, attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points the the Wookiee.
BEN This is Chewbacca. He’s first- mate on a ship that might suit our needs. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro-droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street.
THREEPIO I don’t like the look of this. INT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – CANTINA
Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old. A mercenary on a starship, he

is simple, sentimental, and cocksure.
HAN Han Solo. I’m captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie
here tells me you’re looking for passage to the Alderaan system. BEN Yes, indeed. If it’s a fast ship.
HAN Fast ship? You’ve never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN Should I have?
HAN It’s the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
Ben reacts to Solo’s stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.
HAN (continuing) I’ve outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk- cruisers, mind you. I’m talking about the big Corellian ships now. She’s fast enough for you, old man. What’s the cargo?
BEN Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
BEN Let’s just say we’d like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. HAN Well, that’s the real trick, isn’t it? And it’s going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! HAN But who’s going to fly it, kid! You?
LUKE You bet I could. I’m not such a bad pilot myself! We don’t
have to sit here and listen...
BEN We haven’t that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN Seventeen, huh!
Han ponders this for a few moments.
HAN Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN Ninety-four.
HAN Looks like somebody’s beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The bartender points to the booth.
TROOPER All right, we’ll check it out.
The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
HAN Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her

ready. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
BEN You’ll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE That’s okay. I’m never coming back to this planet again. INT. MOS EISLEY – CANTINA
As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
GREEDO Going somewhere, Solo?
HAN Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money.
Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him.
GREEDO It’s too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba’s put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I’m lucky I found you first. HAN Yeah, but this time I got the money.
GREEDO If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
HAN I don’t have it with me. Tell Jabba...
GREEDO Jabba’s through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
HAN Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
GREEDO You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. HAN Over my dead body.
GREEDO That’s the idea I’ve been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
HAN Yes, I’ll bet you have.
Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patrons look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves.
HAN Sorry about the mess. EXT. SPACE
Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
VADER Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
TARKIN Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of

persuasion.
VADER What do you mean?
TARKIN I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this
station. (to soldier) Set your course for Princess Leia’s home planet of Alderaan.
TROOPER With pleasure. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds. THREEPIO Lock the door, Artoo.
One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.
TROOPER All right, check that side of the street. It’s secure. Move on to the next door.
The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.
THREEPIO I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don’t know what all this trouble is about, but
I’m sure it must be your fault.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
THREEPIO You watch your language! EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET – ALLEYWAY – USED SPEEDER LOT
Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.
LUKE He says it’s the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they just aren’t in demand.
BEN It will be enough.
Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley.
BEN If the ship’s as fast as he’s boasting, we ought to do well. INT. DOCKING BAY 94 – DAY
Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple

creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth. JABBA Come on out, Solo!
A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.
HAN I’ve been waiting for you, Jabba.
JABBA I expected you would be.
HAN I’m not the type to run.
JABBA (fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven’t you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we’ve been through together. HAN You sent Greedo to blast me.
JABBA (mock surprise) Han, why you’re the best smuggler in the business. You’re too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn’t going to blast you.
HAN I think he thought he was. Next time don’t send one of those twerps. If you’ve got something to say to me, come see me yourself. JABBA Han, Han! If only you hadn’t had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can’t make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It’s not good business.
HAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I’ve got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
JABBA (to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I’m only doing this because you’re the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I’ll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I’ll put a price on your head so large you won’t be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
HAN Jabba, I’ll pay you because it’s my pleasure. EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY – ALLEYWAY
Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94. Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street. Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot. He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter. INT MOS

EISLEY SPACEPORT – DOCKING BAY 94
Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship.
LUKE What a piece of junk.
The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.
HAN She’ll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts, kid. I’ve added
some special modifications myself.
Luke scratches his head. It’s obvious he isn’t sure about all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow.
HAN We’re a little rushed, so if you’ll hurry aboard we’ll get out of here.
The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han
Solo. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
Chewbacca settles into the pilot’s chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship. INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT – DOCKING BAY 94
Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo.
THREEPIO Hello, sir. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature. TROOPER Which way?
The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay. TROOPER All right, men. Load your weapons! INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT – DOCKING BAY 94
The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance.
TROOPER Stop that ship!
Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.
TROOPER Blast ‘em!
Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
HAN Chewie, get us out of here!
The group straps in for take off.

THREEPIO Oh, my. I’d forgotten how much I hate space travel. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREETS
The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han climbs into the pilot’s chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope. EXT. SPACE – PLANET TATOOINE
The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han frantically types information into the ship’s computer. Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.
HAN It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. EXT. SPACE – PLANET TATOOINE
The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet. It is followed by two huge Imperial Star Destroyers. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.
HAN Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they’re going to try to cut us off.
LUKE Why don’t you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
HAN Watch your mouth, kid, or you’re going to find yourself
floating home. We’ll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We’ll lose them! EXT. SPACE – PLANET TATOOINE
Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.
HAN Here’s where the fun begins!
BEN How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN It’ll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-
computer.
The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

LUKE Are you kidding? At the rate they’re gaining...
HAN Traveling through hyperspace isn’t like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that’d end your trip real quick, wouldn’t it?
The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash.
LUKE What’s that flashing?
HAN We’re losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I’m going to make the jump to light speed.
The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace. EXT. SPACE
The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second. EXT. DEATH STAR
Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet.
MOTTI We’ve entered the Alderaan system.
Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her hands are bound.
LEIA Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you
holding Vader’s leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
TARKIN Charming to the last. You don’t know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA I’m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
TARKIN Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
LEIA The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that’ll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station’s destructive
power... on your home planet of Alderaan.

LEIA No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can’t possibly...
TARKIN You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.
TARKIN I grow tired of asking this. So it’ll be the last time. Where
is the Rebel base?
Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan.
LEIA (softly) Dantooine.
Leia lowers her head.
LEIA They’re on Dantooine.
TARKIN There. You see Lord Vader, she can be
reasonable. (addressing Motti) Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
LEIA What?
TARKIN You’re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don’t worry. We will deal with your
Rebel friends soon enough.
LEIA No! INT. DEATH STAR – BLAST CHAMBER
VADER Commence primary ignition.
A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON– CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small “seeker” robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, seems almost faint.
LUKE Are you all right? What’s wrong?
BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I
fear something terrible has happened.
Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes his gaze on Luke.
BEN You’d better get on with your exercises.
Han Solo enters the room.
HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I

told you I’d outrun ‘em.
Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.
HAN Don’t everyone thank me at once.
Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board.
HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-covered arms over his head. THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo.
Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca’s face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.
THREEPIO He made a fair move. Screaming about it won’t help you. HAN (interrupting) Let him have it. It’s not wise to upset a Wookiee. THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
HAN That’s ’cause droids don’t pull people’s arms out of their
socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
THREEPIO I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness.
BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. LUKE You mean it controls your actions?
BEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a “seeker”, a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then to the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke’s face. Luke doesn’t move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a
good blaster at your side, kid.
LUKE You don’t believe in the Force, do you?
HAN Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to
make me believe there’s one all-powerful force controlling everything. There’s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. Ben smiles quietly
HAN It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke.
Ben places a large helmet on Luke’s head which covers his eyes. BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
LUKE (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can’t even see. How am I supposed to fight?
BEN Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
BEN Stretch out with your feelings.
Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position.
BEN You see, you can do it.
HAN I call it luck.
BEN In my experience, there’s no such thing as luck.
HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That’s something else.
Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel. HAN Looks like we’re coming up on Alderaan.
Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
LUKE You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. BEN That’s good. You have taken your first step into a larger
world. INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.
TARKIN Yes.
OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been

deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
TARKIN She lied! She lied to us!
VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. TARKIN Terminate her... immediately! EXT. HYPERSPACE
The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship. HAN What the...? Aw, we’ve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It’s not on any of the charts. The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.
LUKE What’s going on?
HAN Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
LUKE What do you mean? Where is it?
HAN Thats what I’m trying to tell you, kid. It ain’t there. It’s been totally blown away.
LUKE What? How?
Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down.
BEN Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN The entire starfleet couldn’t destroy the whole planet. It’d take a thousand ships with more fire power than I’ve...
A signal light starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming.
HAN There’s another ship coming in.
LUKE Maybe they know what happened.
BEN It’s an Imperial fighter.
Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.
LUKE It followed us!
BEN No. It’s a short range fighter.
HAN There aren’t any bases around here. Where did it come
from? EXT. SPACE

The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we’re in big trouble.
HAN Not if I can help it. Chewie... jam it’s transmissions.
BEN It’d be as well to let it go. It’s too far out of range.
HAN Not for long... EXT. SPACE
The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca.
BEN A fighter that size couldn’t get this deep into space on its own. LUKE Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...
HAN Well, he ain’t going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. EXT. SPACE
The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet. LUKE Look at him. He’s heading for that small moon.
HAN I think I can get him before he gets there... he’s almost in range. The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station.
BEN That’s no moon! It’s a space station.
HAN It’s too big to be a space station.
LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this.
BEN Turn the ship around!
HAN Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.
The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station.
LUKE Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN We’re caught in a tractor beam! It’s pulling us in!
LUKE But there’s gotta be something you can do!
HAN There’s nothin’ I can do about it, kid. I’m in full power. I’m
going to have to shut down. But they’re not going to get me without a fight!

Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.
BEN You can’t win. But there are alternatives to fighting. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – DEATH STAR
As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged. EXT. DEATH STAR – HUGE PORT DOORS The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons.
VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM Clear Bay twenty-three- seven. We are opening the magnetic field. INT. DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY 2037
The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area.
OFFICER To your stations!

Stormtroopers run to their posts. INT. DEATH STAR – HANGAR 2037
A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire. OFFICER Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.
TARKIN Yes.
VOICE (over intercom) We’ve captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It’s markings match those of a
ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
VADER They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. INT. DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY 2037
Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.
VOICE (over intercom) Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
OFFICER (to Vader) There’s no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

VADER Did you find any droids?
OFFICER No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also
have jettisoned.
VADER Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
OFFICER Yes, sir.
VADER I sense something... a presence I haven’t felt since...
Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.
OFFICER Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – HALLWAY
A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker. LUKE Boy, it’s lucky you had these compartments.
HAN I use them for smuggling. I never thought I’d be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I’d never get past the tractor beam.
BEN Leave that to me!
HAN Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
BEN Who’s the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him? Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY
The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.
TROOPER The ship’s all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let’s go.
The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.
HAN’S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard. INT. DEATH STAR – FORWARD BAY – COMMAND OFFICE In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.
GANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two. Why aren’t you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear, indicating his comlink is not

working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.
GANTRY OFFICER Take over. We’ve got a bad transmitter. I’ll see what I can do.
As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone-chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper.
Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet. LUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it’s a wonder the whole station doesn’t know we’re here. HAN Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
THREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir.
Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
BEN Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire
Imperial computer network.
Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.
THREEPIO He says he’s found the main control to the power beam that’s holding the ship here. He’ll try to make the precise
location appear on the monitor.
The computer monitor flashes readouts.
THREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
BEN I don’t think you boys can help. I must go alone.
HAN Whatever you say. I’ve done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
LUKE I want to go with you.
BEN Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
LUKE But he can...

BEN They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you ... always!
Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long gray hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement.
HAN Boy you said it, Chewie.
Han looks at Luke.
HAN Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE Ben is a great man.
HAN Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
LUKE I didn’t hear you give any ideas...
HAN Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...
LUKE Who do you think...
Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. Luke goes over to him.
LUKE What is it?
THREEPIO I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir. He says “I found her,” and keeps repeating, “She’s here.”
LUKE Well, who... who has he found?
Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
THREEPIO Princess Leia.
LUKE The princess? She’s here?
HAN Princess?
LUKE Where... where is she?
HAN Princess? What’s going on?
THREEPIO Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three. I’m afraid she’s scheduled to be terminated.
LUKE Oh, no! We’ve got to do something.
HAN What are you talking about?
LUKE The droid belongs to her. She’s the one in the message. We’ve got to help her.
HAN Now, look, don’t get any funny ideas. The old man wants us
to wait right here.
LUKE But he didn’t know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
HAN I’m not going anywhere.
LUKE They’re going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you

said you didn’t want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
HAN Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. LUKE But they’re going to kill her!
HAN Better her than me... LUKE She’s rich. Chewbacca growls.
HAN Rich?
LUKE Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
HAN What?
LUKE Well more wealth that you can imagine.
HAN I don’t know, I can imagine quite a bit! LUKE You’ll get it!
HAN I better!
LUKE You will...
HAN All right, kid. But you’d better be right about this! Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt. LUKE All right.
HAN What’s your plan?
LUKE Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
LUKE Okay. Now, I’m going to put these on you.
Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
LUKE Okay. Han, you put these on.
Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
HAN Don’t worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
THREEPIO Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we’re discovered here?
LUKE Lock the door!
HAN And hope they don’t have blasters.
THREEPIO That isn’t very reassuring.
Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION AREA – ELEVATOR TUBE
Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant

Wookiee a curious glance.
Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
LUKE I can’t see a thing in this helmet.
A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN HALLWAY
Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him. INT. DEATH STAR – INT. ELEVATOR – DETENTION SECURITY AREA
Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old gray security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
HAN This is not going to work.
LUKE Why didn’t you say so before?
HAN I did say so before! INT. DETENTION AREA
Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio. OFFICER Where are you taking this... thing?
Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up. LUKE Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.
OFFICER I wasn’t notified. I’ll have to clear it.
The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca’s electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han’s laser rifle.
HAN Look out! He’s loose!
LUKE He’s going to pull us all apart.
HAN Go get him!
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial

guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. He quickly checks the computer readout.
HAN We’ve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one- eight-seven. You go get her. I’ll hold them here.
Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the buzzing comlink.
HAN (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation normal. INTERCOM VOICE What happened?
HAN (getting nervous) Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything’s perfectly all right now. We’re fine. We’re all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?
INTERCOM VOICE We’re sending a squad up.
HAN Uh, uh, negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous. INTERCOM VOICE Who is this? What’s your operating number?
Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.
HAN Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We’re going to have company! INT. DEATH STAR – CELL ROW
Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with his laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.
LEIA (finally) Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?
Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.
LUKE What? Oh... the uniform. I’m Luke Skywalker. I’m here
to rescue you.
LEIA You’re who?
LUKE I’m here to rescue you. I’ve got your R2 unit. I’m here with
Ben Kenobi.
LEIA Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
LUKE Come on! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table.
VADER He is here...
TARKIN Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?

VADER A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
TARKIN Surely he must be dead by now.
VADER Don’t underestimate the Force.
TARKIN The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that’s left of their religion. There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.
TARKIN Yes.
INTERCOM VOICE Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.
TARKIN The princess! Put all sections on alert!
VADER Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
TARKIN If you’re right, he must not be allowed to escape.
VADER Escape may not his plan. I must face him alone. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION AREA – HALLWAY
An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door.
HAN Chewie!
Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.
HAN Get behind me! Get behind me!
A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
Han and Chewie fire their laser pistols at them through the smoke and flames. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.
HAN Can’t get out that way.
LEIA Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN (sarcastically) Maybe you’d like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor.
LUKE See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
THREEPIO (over comlink) Yes sir?
LUKE We’ve been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn’t copy! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN BAY GANTRY – CONTROL TOWER
Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter. THREEPIO I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence,

sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.
Someone begins banging on the door.
TROOPER VOICE Open up in there!
THREEPIO Oh, no! INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION CORRIDOR Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor. LUKE There isn’t any other way out.
HAN I can’t hold them off forever! Now what?
LEIA This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn’t you have
a plan for getting out?
HAN (pointing to Luke) He’s the brains, sweetheart.
Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
LUKE Well, I didn’t...
The princess grabs Luke’s gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
HAN What the hell are you doing?
LEIA Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.
HAN Get in there you big furry oaf! I don’t care what you smell! Get in there and don’t worry about it.
Han gives him a big kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.
HAN Wonderful girl! Either I’m going to kill her or I’m beginning to like her. Get in there!
Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smoky cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone. INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM Han tumbles into a large room filled with garbage and muck. Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won’t budge.
HAN (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you’ve discovered! Let’s get out of here! Get away from there...

LUKE No! wait!
Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.
LUKE Will you forget it? I already tried it. It’s magnetically sealed! LEIA Put that thing away! You’re going to get us all killed.
HAN Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under
control until you led us down here. You know, it’s not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA It could be worse...
A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.
HAN It’s worse.
LUKE There’s something alive in here!
HAN That’s your imagination.
LUKE Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? HAN What?
LUKE Help!
Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
HAN Luke! Luke! Luke!
Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat.
LEIA Luke!
Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
LEIA Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
LUKE Blast it, will you! My gun’s jammed.
HAN Where?
LUKE Anywhere! Oh!!
Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle.
HAN Luke! Luke!
Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.
LEIA Grab him!

Luke seems to be released by the thing.
LEIA What happened?
LUKE I don’t know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
HAN I’ve got a very bad feeling about this.
Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels.
LUKE The walls are moving!
LEIA Don’t just stand there. Try and brace it with something.
They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn’t look too good.
LUKE Wait a minute!
Luke pulls out his comlink.
LUKE Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he
be? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN GANTRY – COMMAND OFFICE
A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See- Threepio can be heard on Threepio’s hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.
FIRST TROOPER Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to him! Look there!
A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office.
THREEPIO They’re madmen! They’re heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST OFFICER (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard.
The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Come on!
The guard aims a blaster at them.
THREEPIO Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of
my counterpart here. If you don’t mind, I’d like to take him down to maintenance.
TROOPER All right.
The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door. INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.

Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.
LUKE Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash.
HAN Get to the top!
LEIA I can’t
LUKE Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come
in? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL THREEPIO They aren’t here! Something must have happened to them. See if they’ve been captured.
Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot. THREEPIO Hurry! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han’s hand and holds it tightly. She’s terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body.
HAN One thing’s for sure. We’re all going to be a lot thinner! (to Leia) Get on top of it!
LEIA I’m trying! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven’t found them! Where could they be?
Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
THREEPIO Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze. Luke’s comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
Muffled sounds of Luke’s voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly.
THREEPIO Are you there, sir? INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
LUKE Threepio! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
THREEPIO We’ve had some problems...

LUKE (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? INT. DEATH STAR — GARBAGE ROOM.
LUKE Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
LUKE (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from Luke’s comlink.
THREEPIO Listen to them! They’re dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn’t fast enough. It’s all my fault! My poor master!
LUKE (over comlink) Threepio, we’re all right! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the background.
LUKE We’re all right. You did great.
Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number. LUKE Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number ... where are we? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
Threepio looks at the computer panel as Han reads the number.
HAN (over comlink) Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. INT. DEATH STAR – TRACTOR BEAM – POWER GENERATOR TRENCH
Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The clacking sound of a huge switching devices can be heard. The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables. He carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue. INT. DEATH STAR – UNUSED HALLWAY
The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway. Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts. HAN If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to
be able to get out of here.
Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo. LUKE Well, let’s get moving!
Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

HAN (to Chewie) Where are you going?
The dianoga bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim. Han aims his pistol.
LEIA No, wait. They’ll hear!
Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply shakes his head in disgust.
HAN (to Chewie) Come here, you big coward!
Chewie shakes his head “no.”
HAN Chewie! Come here!
LEIA Listen. I don’t know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
HAN Look, Your Worshipfulness, let’s get one thing straight! I
take orders from one person! Me!
LEIA It’s a wonder you’re still alive. (looking at Chewie) Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.
HAN No reward is worth this.
They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor. INT. DEATH STAR – POWER TRENCH
Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him. OFFICER Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
FIRST TROOPER Give me regular reports.
All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
FIRST TROOPER Do you know what’s going on?
SECOND TROOPER Maybe it’s another drill.
Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway.
SECOND TROOPER What was that?
FIRST TROOPER Oh, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers are

milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
HAN (looking at his ship) There she is.
LUKE See-Threepio, do you copy?
THREEPIO (voice) For the moment. Uh, we’re in the main hangar across from the ship.
LUKE We’re right above you. Stand by.
Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship.
LEIA You came in that thing? You’re braver that I thought.
HAN Nice! Come on!
Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
FIRST TROOPER It’s them! Blast them!
Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
HAN (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship!
LUKE Where are you going? Come back!
Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
LEIA He certainly has courage.
LUKE What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! Luke is furious but doesn’t have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate. Han’s determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY
Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca

turns and starts running the other way also. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY
Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway. INT. DEATH STAR – CENTRAL CORE SHAFT
Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back.
LUKE (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn.
Blasts from the stormtroopers’ laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
LEIA There’s no lock!
Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
LUKE That oughta hold it for a while.
LEIA Quick, we’ve got to get across. Find the control that extends
the bridge.
LUKE Oh, I think I just blasted it.
Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
LEIA They’re coming through!
Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troopers appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest.
Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke’s laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
LUKE Here, hold this.
Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. It has a grappler hook on it.
A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia.

As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well. Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops.
LEIA Here they come!
Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.
LEIA For luck!
Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway. INT. DEATH STAR – NARROW PASSAGEWAY
Ben hides in the shadows of a narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to make sure they’re gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp.
THREEPIO Where could they be?
Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response. INT. DEATH STAR – CORRIDOR – BLAST SHIELDS DOOR
Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail.
TROOPER Close the blast doors!
At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut. TROOPER Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY
Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader

lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward. VADER I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.
Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance. VADER When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master. BEN Only a master of evil, Darth.
The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his head.
Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi’s blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.
VADER Your powers are weak, old man.
BEN You can’t win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become
more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY
Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
HAN Didn’t we just leave this party?
Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.
HAN What kept you?
LEIA We ran into some old friends.
LUKE Is the ship all right?
HAN Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group’s vantage point.
LUKE Look!
Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader

emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay. INT. DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY
Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star’s Imperial docking bay.
THREEPIO Come on, Artoo, we’re going!
Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and the Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The troops rush toward the battling knights.
HAN Now’s our chance! Go!
They start for the Millennium Falcon.
Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader takes advantage of Ben’s momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.
The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword from Vader’s then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face.
Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben’s cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. Vader is puzzled at Ben’s disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship.
Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out. LUKE No!
The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him. The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.
HAN (to Luke) Come on!
LEIA Come on! Luke, its too late!
HAN Blast the door! Kid!
Luke fires his laser pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them... shutting Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumples to the floor.

BEN’S VOICE Run, Luke! Run!
Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. The dull thud of laserbolts can be heard bouncing off the outside of the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.
HAN I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!
Chewbacca growls in agreement. EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She sits down beside him. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Solo spots approaching enemy ships.
HAN (to Chewie) We’re coming up on the sentry ships. Hold ‘em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.
LUKE I can’t believe he’s gone.
Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.
LEIA There wasn’t anything you could have done.
Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the princess. HAN (to Luke) Come on, buddy, we’re not out of this yet! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS – COCKPIT
Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – HOLD AREA
Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads for the cockpit. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS – COCKPIT Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large rotating turrets on either side of the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – SOLO’S GUNPORT
Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.
HAN (to Luke) You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp! INT. MILLENNIUM

Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – CHEWBACCA
The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the cockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia. EXT. TIE FIGHTER – SPACE Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame, firing on the pirate starship. EXT. SPACE – TIE FIGHTERS
The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the

pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – MAIN PASSAGEWAY
A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips.
THREEPIO Oooh! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT – GUNPORTS
Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the ship’s controls.
LEIA We’ve lost lateral controls.
HAN Don’t worry, she’ll hold together.
An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship’s control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.
HAN (to ship) You hear me, baby? Hold together!
Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT
Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter with his laser cannon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT

A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs victoriously. EXT. SPACE
Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular direct hit.
LUKE Got him! I got him!
Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully returns. HAN Great kid! Don’t get cocky.
Han turns back to his laser cannon. EXT. SPACE

Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports.
LEIA There are still two more of them out there! EXT. SPACE A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Luke and Han look into their respective projected target screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo’s port, and Han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke’s port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face. EXT. SPACE
The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORTS
Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke’s projected screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by enemy fire. EXT. SPACE – TIE FIGHTER
The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, firing upon the Falcon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – GUNPORT
Solo swivels behind his laser cannon, his aim describing the arc of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo’s laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments.
LUKE (laughing) That’s it! We did it!
The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.
LEIA We did it! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – PASSAGEWAY Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires.
THREEPIO Help! I think I’m melting! (to Artoo) This is all your fault. Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response. EXT. SPACE – MILLENNIUM FALCON
The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically through space. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.
TARKIN Are they away?
VADER They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
TARKIN You’re sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I’m taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. INT.

MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage. Leia is seated near Han.
HAN Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
LEIA That doesn’t sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It’s the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA Their tracking us!
HAN Not this ship, sister.
Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.
LEIA At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN What’s so important? What’s he carrying?
LEIA The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope
that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It’s
not over yet!
HAN It is for me, sister! Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution, and I’m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the money!
LEIA You needn’t worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that’s what you’ll receive!
She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, passes Luke coming in.
LEIA Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
LUKE I care!
Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space.
LUKE So... what do you think of her, Han?
HAN I’m trying not to, kid!
LUKE (under his breath) Good...
HAN Still, she’s got a lot of spirit. I don’t know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
LUKE No!
Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at young Luke’s jealousy. EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN
The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons. EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

The pirateship soars over the dense jungle. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST
An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside. He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – JUNGLE TEMPLE
Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops.
Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder. INT. MASSASSI – MAIN HANGAR DECK
The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her. WILLARD (holding Leia) You’re safe! We had feared the worst.
Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.
WILLARD When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
LEIA We don’t have time for our sorrows, commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. (looking pointedly at Han) It’s the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. EXT. SPACE
The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin. INT. DEATH STAR – CONTROL ROOM
Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Darth Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer the call.
TARKIN Yes.
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE We are approaching the
planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We
are preparing to orbit the planet. EXT. YAVIN – JUNGLE
A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green. INT. MASSASSI – WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA
Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. The low- ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is

saying. Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back.
DODONNA The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna.
GOLD LEADER Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
DODONNA Well, the Empire doesn’t consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they’d have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left.
DODONNA The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
A murmur of disbelief runs through the room.
DODONNA Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray- shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes.
Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old.
WEDGE That’s impossible, even for a computer.
LUKE It’s not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T- sixteen back home. They’re not much bigger than two meters. DODONNA Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
The group rises and begins to leave. EXT. SPACE.
The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon. INT. DEATH STAR
Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it’s position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon.
DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE Orbiting the planet at
maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range
in thirty minutes.
VADER This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of

Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – MAIN HANGAR DECK
Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.
MAN’S VOICE (over loudspeaker) All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots’ preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend’s departure.
LUKE So... you got your reward and you’re just leaving then?
HAN That’s right, yeah! I got some old debts I’ve got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn’t, you don’t think I’d be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don’t you come with us? You’re pretty good in a fight. I could use you.
LUKE (getting angry) Come on! Why don’t you take a look around? You know what’s about to happen, what they’re up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You’re turning your back on them. HAN What good’s a reward if you ain’t around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station ain’t my idea of courage. It’s more like suicide.
LUKE All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that’s
what you’re best at, isn’t it?
Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.
HAN Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off.
Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,
HAN What’re you lookin’ at? I know what I’m doing. INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK – LUKE’S SHIP
Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
LEIA What’s wrong?
LUKE Oh, it’s Han! I don’t know, I really thought he’d change
his mind.
LEIA He’s got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. LUKE I only wish Ben were here.
Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off.
As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs

his arm.
BIGGS Luke! I don’t believe it! How’d you get here... are you going out with us?!
LUKE Biggs! Of course, I’ll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
RED LEADER Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
BIGGS Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter. RED LEADER I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was a great pilot. You’ll do all right. If you’ve got half of your father’s
skill, you’ll do better than all right.
LUKE Thank you, sir. I’ll try.
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
BIGGS I’ve got to get aboard. Listen, you’ll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?
LUKE I told you I’d make it someday, Biggs.
BIGGS (going off) You did, all right. It’s going to be like old times Luke. We’re a couple of shooting stars that’ll never be stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for his ship.
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter. CHIEF This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
LUKE Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. (to Artoo) You okay, Artoo?
The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine.
Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke’s X-wing. It’s an emotion-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye.
CHIEF Okay, easy she goes!
THREEPIO Hang on tight, Artoo, you’ve got to come back.
Artoo beeps in agreement.
THREEPIO You wouldn’t want my life to get boring, would you?

Artoo whistles his reply.
All final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments.
The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
BEN’S VOICE Luke, the Force will be with you.
Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – JUNGLE
All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and disappear into the morning cloud cover. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – WAR ROOM
The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appears around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills the war room.
MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE Stand-by alert. Death
Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen
minutes. EXT. SPACE
The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame. EXT. SPACE – ANOTHER ANGLE
Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly pull away. INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP – COCKPIT
Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights, looking to each side at his wing men.
RED LEADER All wings report in. INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT
One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.

Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted slightly.
RED LEADER (over headset) Switch your deflectors on. INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT
RED LEADER (over headset) Double front! EXT. SPACE
The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna is built into the surface on one side. INT. WEDGE’S COCKPIT
Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome spectacle. WEDGE Look at the size of that thing!
RED LEADER (over headset) Cut the chatter, Red Two. INT. RED LEADER’S COCKPIT
RED LEADER Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! EXT. SPACE
As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half of the deadly space

station is in shadow and this area sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a city at night as seen from a weather satellite. INT. GOLD LEADER’S COCKPIT
GOLD LEADER Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
RED LEADER (over headset) I copy, Gold Leader.
GOLD LEADER We’re starting for the target shaft now. INT. RED LEADER’S COCKPIT
Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in the background. He moves his computer targeting device into position. RED LEADER We’re in position. I’m going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. EXT. SPACE
Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across the dark gray expanse of the huge station. INT. DEATH STAR
Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate the huge guns into position as the crew adjust their targeting devices.
EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR
Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and fires. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – WAR ROOM
Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom. Threepio is at her side.
WEDGE (over war room speaker system) Heavy fire, boss! Twenty- three degrees.

X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star. INT. LUKE’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT
Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit window. LUKE This is Red Five! I’m going in! EXT. SPACE

Luke’s X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak from Luke’s weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on the dim surface. INT. LUKE’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT
Terror crosses Luke’s face as he realizes he won’t be able to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.
BIGGS (over headset) Luke, pull up! EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR
Luke’s ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges of his wings slightly scorched. INT. BIGGS’ COCKPIT
BIGGS Are you all right? INT. LUKE’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT
Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.
LUKE I got a little cooked, but I’m okay. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star’s surface with laserbolts. INT. DEATH STAR
Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble. Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes up to him.
ASTRO-OFFICER We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they’re so small they’re evading our turbo-lasers!
VADER We’ll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. INT. DEATH STAR
Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers’ head gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming noise of the monstrous weapon. One trooper bangs his helmet with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing. INT. READ LEADER’S X-WING FIGHTER – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.
RED LEADER Luke, let me know when you’re going in. INT. LUKE’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
The Red Leader’s X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose down and starts his attack dive.
LUKE I’m on my way in now...
RED LEADER Watch yourself! There’s a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.

LUKE I’m on it. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon and down onto the dim gray surface. EXT. LUKE’S X-WING TRAVELING A shot hurls from Luke’s guns. Laserbolts streak toward the onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on the surface. INT. LUKE’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING
The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit windows as a big smile sweeps across Luke’s face at the success of his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him. EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from the surface towards the heavens. INT. DEATH STAR
The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of explosions. INT. BIGGS’ COCKPIT – TRAVELING
Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides. INT. DEATH STAR Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – WAR ROOM
Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working over a screen speaks into his headset.
CONTROL OFFICER Squad leaders, we’ve picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way. INT. LUKE’S X-WING – COCKPIT – TRAVELING

BEN’S VOICE Remember, the Force will be with you... always.
The ship rocks back and forth. EXT. DARTH VADER’S TIE FIGHTER

Vader’s ship spins off into space. EXT. SPACE
The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – MAIN HANGAR
Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting.
Princess Leia rushes toward him.
LEIA Luke! Luke! Luke!
She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance around a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace one another, slapping each other on the back.
HAN (laughing) Hey! Hey!
LUKE (laughing) I knew you’d come back! I just knew it!
HAN Well, I wasn’t gonna let you get all the credit and take all
the reward.
Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves at Luke’s face. Leia moves in between them.
LEIA (laughing) Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Luke looks toward the ship.
LUKE Oh, no!
The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.
THREEPIO Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! (to mechanic) You can repair him, can’t you?
TECHNICIAN We’ll get to work on him right away.
THREEPIO You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I’ll gladly donate them.
LUKE He’ll be all right. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST – MAIN THRONE ROOM
Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From one side of the temple marches a shined- up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She rises and places a gold medallion around Han’s neck. He winks at her. She then

repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness.
FADE OUT.
END CREDITS OVER STARS.


Title: Star Wars: Return of the Jedi

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
1. SPACE
The boundless heavens serve as a backdrop for the MAIN TITLE. A ROLL-UP crawls into infinity.
The Rebellion is doomed. Spies loyal to the Old Republic have reported several new armored space stations under construction by the Empire.
A desperate plan to attack the Dreaded Imperial capitol of Had Abbadon and destroy the Death Stars before they are completed
has been put into effect.
Rebel commandos, led by Princess Leia, have made their way into the very heart of the Galactic Empire: as the first step toward the final battle for freedom....
Pan down to reveal the planet HAD ABBADON, capitol of the Galactic Empire. The gray planet’s surface is completely covered with cities and is shrouded in a sickly brown haze. Orbiting the polluted planet is a small, green, moon, a sparkling contrast to the foreboding sphere beyond.
A large IMPERIAL TRANSPORT glides into frame. WE follow it, as it rockets toward the Imperial capitol. Four small TIE FIGHTERS escort the larger craft. The web-like structures of two Death Stars under construction loom in the distance as the transport approaches. Resting to one side of the half completed space station is Darth Vader’s super STAR DESTROYER and several ships of the Imperial fleet. One of the TIE Fighters escorting the Imperial transport begins to wobble and drops back with its engine sputtering.
2. INT. TIE FIGHTER A rebel pilot (WEDGE) struggles with his controls and starts to panic. He speaks into his com-link.
WEDGE Commander....I ah....have a problem here! My ship is losing power, I’m not going to make it.
TRANSPORT COMMANDER (female) Take it easy Wedge, switch to your auxiliary converters.
WEDGE I have, it’s no good.
3. INT. IMPERIAL TRANSPORT A scruffy old REBEL PILOT turns to his young CO-PILOT who is frantically working the controls. CO-PILOT He’s out of range, we’ve lost him.
The Pilot quickly checks his controls, then turns to the Commander sitting above and behind them.
PILOT We’re too close to Vader’s fleet to go back for him.
The Commander leans into the light and is revealed to be PRINCESS

LEIA. All eyes on the bridge are on her. She thinks for a moment, then makes a decision.
LEIA Reverse engines.
PILOT Someone is going to start asking questions, and we may not have the answers.
LEIA I have to risk it. They’ll discover us soon enough, if Wedge is taken in for repairs.
Out of the cockpit window is Vader’s Star Destroyer.
4. INT. BRIDGE VADER’S STAR DESTROYER The bridge of the Star Destroyer is a beehive of activity. A long row of controllers study their tracking screens as the ominous sounds of Lord Vader’s boots echo throughout the bridge. The controllers watch in fear as the dark Lord’s feet pass above them. One of the controllers goes back to his work and spots the transport on his screen. A red light starts flashing and a muted buzzer sounds. The controller speaks into his com-link. CONTROLLER Transport TYDIRIUM, you’re moving out of your flight path. Correct immediately.
VOICE OF REBEL PILOT One of our escort fighters has lost power. We’re maneuvering for a tow.
An Imperial Officer moves in behind the Controller and switches off the alarm and light.
OFFICER Check their security clearance.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium, identify and confirm your security status.
5. INT. IMPERIAL TRANSPORT COCKPIT The Pilot and Co-Pilot look back to Leia with worried looks on their faces as the Imperial Controller repeats his request.
LEIA Now we find out if that security code was worth the price we paid. Send the transmission.
The Pilot flips several switches and a high-speed transmission is heard. The Co-Pilot is very nervous.
CO-PILOT What if they changed the code? We don’t know how old this one is.
PILOT Just relax son, we’re not in trouble yet. Activate the tractor beam and lock onto Wedge’s fighter.
The Co-Pilot goes back to his controller. Leia and the Pilot exchange concerned looks.
CO-PILOT We have Wedge in tow, sir.
PILOT Reset your course for the sanctuary moon. Go around Vader’s fleet the long way. We shouldn’t get too close.

An Imperial voice on the com-link breaks in.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium, bring your craft closer to the fleet for a visual check.
A new sense of foreboding sweeps through the cockpit.
PILOT They’re on to us...
CO-PILOT The code’s no good. Abort the mission.
LEIA No! We have to play this one out. Answer them.
PILOT Request acknowledged. We’re swinging closer.
The old Pilot switches off the com-link and looks over to the Co-Pilot who is scared to death, then over to Leia who is lost in thought. PILOT It smells like a trap. Are you sure we shouldn’t abort the mission?
LEIA No...but our fleet will surely be cut to ribbons if we aren’t set up on the moon sanctuary before they arrive. You’d better warn the men. 6. INT. HOLD IMPERIAL TRANSPORT The hold of the transport is filled with Rebel Commandos and massive equipment. A red light goes on as the Pilot’s voice comes over the com-link.
PILOT We are approaching Lord Vader’s fleet for a visual security check. Be on your best Imperial behavior.
The troops start picking up their weapons, and quickly stow any non- Imperial equipment.
7. INT. COCKPIT IMPERIAL TRANSPORT Out the cockpit window Vader’s super Star Destroyer grows larger as the Rebels approach it. CO-PILOT We’re within range of their visual scanners.
PILOT Don’t go in any closer. Watch for approaching fighters.
The old Pilot turns and sees that Leia is overcome with melancholy. Her head is resting in her hands. The old Pilot moves over to the young Princess to comfort her. She looks up at him and wipes the tears from her eyes, as he puts his hand on her shoulder.
PILOT It’s all right. We’ve been in tougher scrapes than this. We’ll get through.
LEIA I know.... I just wish Han were here.
PILOT These are the moments that we all miss Captain Solo....
She forces a weak little smile.
PILOT (continued) A small bet. Commander Skywalker will have him back in time for the main attack.
LEIA Lando’s signal only meant they’ve found Han alive, not how difficult it will be to free him.
The com-link cracks to life, causing everyone to jump. The Pilot rushes back to his controls.

IMPERIAL VOICE What is your cargo, Transport Tydirium?
8. INT. BRIDGE VADER’S SUPER STAR DESTROYER The Imperial Officer leans closer to the view screen; which flashes a series of x-ray images of the interior of the transport. The controller repeats his question.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Do you copy? What is your cargo?
PILOT VOICE Equipment and construction personnel for the sanctuary moon...
The officer is called over to another view screen.
SECOND CONTROLLER The shuttle is approaching. High speed on course 973.
OFFICER Alert all Commands. I’ll inform Lord Vader....
He turns back to the first controller.
OFFICER (continued) Record your scan of the transport, we’ll go over it later.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium....
9. INT. COCKPIT IMPERIAL TRANSPORT Tension is high in the cockpit of the transport as they await their fate.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER (continued) .... Stand by.
They look out the cockpit window at Vader’s super Star Destroyer which looms before them. Suddenly the control panel lights up and alarms go off.
CO-PILOT Imperial fighter.... moving up fast behind us!
Leia speaks into the com-link.
LEIA All units prepare for a boarding party.
PILOT Stand by to activate shields.
LEIA Wait, it’s not slowing.
PILOT And it’s not firing either.
CO-PILOT It’s going to pass us.
The com-link sparks to life.
Outside the cockpit window an Imperial shuttle roars past them heading for Vader’s ship.
LEIA Those are royal markings on that shuttle. Somebody important is in a big hurry to see Lord Vader.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium you are cleared to proceed to the moon sanctuary.
There is a big sigh of relief from Leia and the Pilots.
CO-PILOT We made it. The code works.
PILOT I still don’t like it. Change to course 339. We’ll go the long way around.

Leia and the Pilots watch the shuttle recede in the distance. CO-PILOT Nothing can stop us now!
10. EXT. SPACE – TRANSPORT AND SHUTTLE The huge Imperial Transport veers away from Vader’s super Star Destroyer and heads for the distant sanctuary moon. The Imperial shuttle continues towards Vader’s ship until it finally disappears into the main docking bay on top of the huge Star Destroyer.
11. INT. MAIN BAY Super Star Destroyer As the shuttle settles onto the deck of the docking bay, Imperial ground crews rush about securing the craft. The bay is filled with an impressive formation of Stormtroopers, Guards, Star Captains, and Special Elite Units. As one, the thousands of troops snap to attention, and heads turn to the entrance of the bay. The door slides open revealing the dark Lord of the Sith, DARTH VADER. He walks past the troops toward the shuttle craft. ADMIRAL PIETT and several Star Captains are with him. The Admiral turns to Vader.
PIETT Never before have I heard of the GRAND MOFF leaving the planet to greet someone. You are greatly respected, my Lord. VADER Or greatly feared. The disgusting little bureaucrat is attempting to lay a trap for me.
PIETT He’s a fool to think that you would not know.
VADER The Emperor’s counsel is no fool. He is very clever and quite dangerous.
Vader and Piett stop before the Imperial shuttle. The hatch to the shuttle swings down and a colorful platoon of the Imperial Guards lines up outside the ramp. They salute as a thin, evil-looking man descends from the shuttle. He is the GRAND MOFF JERJERROD. Vader salutes him, but Admiral Piett and all the Star Captains kneel before him. An effete covey of dignitaries descend the ramp, acting as if they have never been on a Starship before.
VADER You honor me with your presence, My Lord.
JERJERROD Yes, I know. (looking around) You may rise. All this fuss just for me, an impressive display I must say. (sniffs the air) Yes, well the Emperor sends you his blessing....
VADER But he still refuses to answer my transmissions. JERJERROD I’m afraid he’s quite too busy.
VADER Then why was I ordered to return?
JERJERROD He feels your prolonged stay in the outer systems has not agreed with you.
Vader is very angry and it takes all the control he can muster to

contain himself. Jerjerrod starts for the hanger entrance. Vader follows.
VADER Don’t you toy with me.
JERJERROD All right then.... the Emperor is disturbed with your failure to deal with young Skywalker and he has decided to handle the matter personally. You will supervise the construction of the Battle Stations; a task he feels will be much less demanding.
VADER But, I have all but turned him to the dark side of the force. JERJERROD The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. Skywalker is more powerful now, than before your feeble attempts to convert him.
12. INT. BRIDGE STAR DESTROYER Vader, Jerjerrod and company walk onto the vast Star Destroyer bridge.
VADER He can’t do this. The boy is mine!
JERJERROD That seems to be part of the problem. It would appear that you still have some feelings for your troublesome offspring. VADER The only feeling I have for him is hatred.
JERJERROD Then you should be thankful the Emperor has taken such an interest in him. The Emperor will turn Skywalker to the dark side, and then destroy the Rebellion in one swift stroke.
VADER The Rebellion will not be easily crushed, and my son will not be easily turned.
JERJERROD The Emperor will succeed, where you have failed. You are weak Lord Vader, more machine than man. The Emperor’s plan has already been put into motion. The entire rebel force is on its way to us, for one last, hopeless confrontation, so I suggest you prepare your fleet.
VADER My son would not be so foolish as to fall into such a trap. JERJERROD Ahh but, he is not with them. Your son is on his home planet of Tatooine. He will soon be in our hands, and the Emperor will have his way with him.
VADER Get off my bridge!
JERJERROD As you wish...
The Grand Moff turns and walks off the bridge followed by the dignitaries. The Admiral and his Captains go back to their duties. Vader stand alone on the bridge looking out across the vast sea of stars.
VADER (to himself) Luke, beware, you are the Emperor’s prey now. DISSOLVE TO
13. INT. TATOOINE INN

["In the rough draft Luke is asleep and struggling with thoughts of Vader and the dark side. Yoda and Ben are also present in the dream, and Luke berates Ben for not telling him that Vader is his father. Yoda explains that he'll soon be joining Ben in the Netherworld, and therefore he'll become stronger and will be better able to help Luke. Vader's voice reappears, and Luke awakens." -L. Bouzerau, explanation from Star Wars The Annotated Screenplays page 241.]
Luke snaps awake from a sound sleep, his head still ringing with Vader’s words. It takes a moment for him to focus on his surroundings. He is in a small rundown, tavern. Two vile, little dirty Jawas; ATETU and TWEETU, stare at him from across the room. They shake their cloak-covered heads and go back to cooking an odorous stew.
The howling wind outside blows the door open with a loud crash. Luke reaches for his pistol, the Jawas hide. Out of the dust cloud emerge two familiar shapes, SEE THREEPIO and ARTOO DETOO. Luke relaxes as the angry Jawas come out of hiding, scolding the robots for not closing the door. Atetu waddles to the door and strains against the wind to close it.
THREEPIO Master Luke, I beg you not to send us out in weather like that again...it’s unbearable out there.
Artoo whistles his agreement.
LUKE Were you able to get everything I asked for?
THREEPIO An impossible task, but yes we have all of it....Artoo? Artoo beeps and one of his tiny arms pokes out of its hatch carrying a small box. The door to the hovel bangs open again giving everyone a start, including R-2 who drops the box of parts. Out of the cloud of dust comes LANDO and CHEWIE. Atetu is very angry and starts yelling at Lando and Chewie. The little Jawa storms over to Chewie and screams at the Wookiee (in his gibberish language), shaking his fist. Chewie stares at him blankly, then shrugs and closes the door. Atetu continues to vent his anger on Luke, then waddles back to his cooking.
LANDO Next time I’ll try to get us better accommodations, but trustworthy innkeepers are hard to come by around here.
Chewie barks and puts several small parts before Luke.
LUKE What did you find out?
LANDO He survived the unfreezing process but I couldn’t get any report on his condition; but we’re going to have to hurry, the

execution has been set for tomorrow.
Threepio picks up a small micro chip.
THREEPIO Master Luke, I beg your pardon, but how can these micro parts help rescue Capt. Solo?
Luke holds up an odd looking box.
LUKE When it’s finished it will be our ticket into the palace. But first, we must send this JABBA the HUTT a message. That’s where you two can help.
THREEPIO At your service.
Tweetu calls out and points to the bowls of steaming food on the table. Chewie barks and heads for the table followed by Lando. LANDO Better get something to eat, Luke, we may not get another chance.
LUKE You go ahead, I still have some things to do first. (motions to R-2) Come over here, Artoo.
Threepio follows Chewie to the table and asks Tweetu something. The creature answers and goes to a cupboard. Threepio sits at the table. On the far side of the room Luke stands before Artoo and recites a message. A beam of light from Artoo passes over him as he speaks. Tweetu brings Threepio an oil can, and Threepio starts oiling his joints.
THREEPIO A few more trips outside and I’ll surely short circuit. Chewie barks and Lando passes him some food.
LANDO It’s a miracle that Han survived the unfreezing process. I just hope he’s still in one piece.
Chewie barks his agreement. Luke and R-2 come over to the others. R-2 begins to beep at 3PO.
THREEPIO We have to leave?!? What are you talking about? I’m not going out in that storm again!
LUKE 3PO, I need you to go with him to the palace.
THREEPIO Palace?!?
LUKE He’s going to need your help.
THREEPIO Help!?!
Artoo beeps at Threepio again.
THREEPIO All right, I’m coming. I’m coming. I was afraid of this. Master Luke, are you sure...
LUKE Threepio.... I’m depending on you.
THREEPIO Yes, Master Luke.
Artoo and Threepio leave the Inn as the wind howls madly outside. Luke grabs some food off of the table and goes back to his work.

LANDO What makes you think those droids will ever get in to see Jabba – let alone deliver the message.
LUKE Greed. It’s Jabba’s weakness. With this phony spice extractor and his greed, we’ll make contact with Han as soon as I finish. You and Chewie are going to have to make the next visit to the palace. LANDO You mean just walk right in?? They’ll kill us.
LUKE Not when you present Jabba with this little gem, and tell him we have a hundred more just like it. You’ll be all right.
LANDO But we don’t have another hundred just like it. I think this plan of yours leaves a lot to be desired.
LUKE Listen, Lando, you know we couldn’t get Han out of that stronghold even if we had an army with us. Our only hope is to get Jabba to take him out of there, for us....
LANDO Then what?
LUKE Then you leave the rest to me.
Lando shakes his head in disbelief.
LANDO I sure hope you know what you’re doing.
Chewie concurs, as Luke goes back to working on his gift.
14. EXT. ROAD TO PALACE – GATE The wind has died down somewhat, but a fair amount of sand still flows around the two droids as they struggle along the path to the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt. R-2 whistles a worried sigh.
THREEPIO Why are droids always given the dirty work?.... Sometimes I wonder why we put up with it all.
Artoo beeps his agreement as they reach the main gate to the Palace. It is closed. Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then he timidly knocks on the giant iron door. A small hatch in the middle of the door snaps open and a spidery mechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects the two droids.
STRANGE VOICE Tee chuta what zudd!
Threepio points to R-2, then to himself.
THREEPIO Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreeiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
The eye looks from one robot to the other, then zips back into the door, and the hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his concern. THREEPIO I don’t think they’re going to let us in, Artoo, maybe we should go.
Artoo agrees, and the droids turn to leave. Suddenly, the massive door starts to rise with an ominous thumping and horrific metallic

screech. The robots turn back toward an endless black cavity which has been revealed beyond the door. The robots look at one another, afraid to go inside.
STRANGE VOICE Nudd chaa!
Artoo starts forward into the black void.
THREEPIO Artoo, maybe we should reconsider the.... Artoo wait! The bronze droid rushes after his stubby companion. The noisy door begins to lower behind them.
15. INT. JABBA’S PALACE – HALLWAY The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant green scaly GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Artoo beeps a weak question. Threepio quickly glances around and looks at the two lumbering lizard-like guards behind him, then turns back to Artoo. The guard grunts an order. THREEPIO You don’t want to know. Just deliver Master Luke’s message and get us out of here quick.
Walking toward them out of the darkness is a wizened old man dressed in a dark cloak and tall hat. This is the High Beeser of Hutt, BIB FORTUNA.
BIB I am Bib Fortuna, the High Beeser of Hutt. What brings you to our domain?
THREEPIO We bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt. Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.
THREEPIO ....and a gift. (thinks a moment then to R-2) Gift, what gift?
BIB Jabba cannot be disturbed, I will take the gift for him.
He holds out his hand toward R-2 and the tiny droid backs up a bit, letting out an array of squeaks and tones.
THREEPIO Artoo give it to him!
Artoo defiantly whistles a blue streak. 3PO turns to the Beeser. THREEPIO He says our master’s instructions are to give it only to Jabba the Hutt himself.
Bib thinks about this for a moment.
THREEPIO I’m terribly sorry. I’m afraid he’s ever so stubborn about these things.
BIB Very well then, follow me.
They troop in behind the Grand Beeser and follow him into the darkness.
THREEPIO Artoo, I have a very bad feeling about this.
16. INT. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER The main chamber in the palace

is filled with the most grotesque, and vile CREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio stand very small in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber.
THREEPIO We’re doomed!
Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the room to the leader of this disgusting crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. This Godfather of the galactic crime world is a repulsively fat sultan-like monster with a maniacal grin. Bib whispers something in this slobbering degenerate’s ear. Jabba laughs, and motions to the two terrified droids. He speaks in a strange language to the Grand Beeser.
JABBA (in Huttese) This gift had better be worth it.
The robots reluctantly come forward to stand before this loose- skinned villain.
JABBA (in Huttese) Speak!
THREEPIO (in English) The message Artoo, the message.
Artoo whistles and a beam of light projects from his domed head, creating a HOLOGRAM of Luke on the floor. The image grows to over ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters. Threepio translates.
LUKE Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend of the one called Solo. I wish an audience to bargain for his life.... (all laugh) I have objects of great value from Durell System (the crowd mumbles) and as a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift, these two droids....
Threepio is startled by this announcement.
THREEPIO (in English) What?!? What did he say?
LUKE Both are hard working and will serve you well...I will soon send my agents for your reply.
THREEPIO (in English) Oh no, this can’t be. Artoo you must have played the wrong tape....
JABBA (laughs in Huttese) There will be no bargain, but I will take the droids with pleasure.
He motions for the guards to take the droids away.
BIB (in Huttese) Bargain rather than fight? He’s no Jedi, he’s an imposter.
Jabba concurs and the loathsome courtiers laugh at his response. 17. DUNGEON HALLWAY Artoo and Threepio are led down a dark and dank dungeon passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls, and

occasionally a horrible looking arm, or tentacle grabs through the bars at the two hapless droids.
THREEPIO What could have come over Master Luke? Is it something we did? He never expressed to me any unhappiness with our work. They stop at a door at the end of the hall.
18. INT. BOILER ROOM The door slides open revealing a room filled with steam and noisy machinery. The menacing guard motions them into the boiler room where they are met by a tall, thin, human-like ROBOT named U-8d8 (Eue-Atedeate). The guard grunts to the droid, who is sitting behind a high desk.
ATEDEATE Ah, new acquisitions. I am Eue Atedeate, chief of Cyborg Operations. You’re a protocol droid, aren’t you?
THREEPIO I am See Threepio, Human....
ATEDEATE Yes or no will do.
THREEPIO Well, yes.
ATEDEATE How many languages do you speak?
THREEPIO I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can....
ATEDEATE Wonderful! We have been without an interpreter since the Master got angry and disintegrated out last protocol droid. THREEPIO Disintegrated??
Atedeate turns to the thick-headed guard.
ATEDEATE This one will be quite useful, fit him with a restraining bolt, then take him back to the main audience chamber.
THREEPIO No wait, Artoo don’t leave me....
The guard pushes Threepio out of the room. Artoo lets out a plaintive cry, as the door closes. He then beeps a blue streak to the operations droid.
ATEDEATE So you’d rather not get stuck cleaning the prison cells, huh. Oh, you’re good at dispensing beverages, are you?
He throws some hoses and mop-like extensions at Artoo. ATEDEATE (Continued) You’ll do clean up! Follow me.
Disappointed, Artoo clutches the apparatus and falls in behind the taller droid.
19. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER The court of Jabba the Hutt is a drunken, raucous assembly. TWO GUARDS bring in a weathered old STAR CAPTAIN, who stands angrily before the slimy rogue. CAPTAIN Listen Jabba, I’m tired of waiting....
JABBA (in Huttese) Bring forth my new protocol droid.
Everyone near him looks around, and finally Threepio is shoved

forward. Jabba motions to the golden droid to come nearer.
JABBA (in Huttese) What is he saying?
THREEPIO (in Huttese) He is tired of waiting, Your Excellency. Jabba jabbers away at Threepio with a chuckle, the interpreter droid turns to the Star Captain.
THREEPIO (in English) His Excellency finds your impatience irritating and has decided not to pay you at all....
CAPTAIN (puts hand on gun) You tell that swollen scumbag he’d better cough up my fee or they’ll be picking his hide out of every crack in this room.
Threepio looks at Jabba, then back to the Star Captain, then back to Jabba. He hesitates to translate this unpleasant message. THREEPIO (in Huttese) Your Grandness, he feels he would not be happy with that arrangement.
Jabba sits with growing anger and 3PO backs away, then the gangster starts to laugh.
JABBA Boscka!
The Star Captain goes for his gun, but before he can draw, a trap door in the floor springs open and swallows him up. The door snaps shut. A rumble is heard, then muffled growls and a hideous scream. Jabba and the court laugh hysterically. Threepio looks up and is terrified to see his old friend Chewbacca, and Lando entering the room followed by two guards.
THREEPIO (in English) Oh no!
Lando and the giant Wookiee stand over the trap door as they greet Jabba the Hutt. Chewie barks, Threepio translates.
THREEPIO (in Huttese) He greets you and wishes you good health, Your Excellency....
Jabba waves at Chewie, and chuckles as he speaks to the Wookiee. THREEPIO (in English) His Excellency is surprised to see you here, Chewbacca, and quite frankly so am I, you’re in grave danger. LANDO We bring you a gift, Exalted One, and more to follow if you accept Skywalker’s bargain.
Threepio repeats this to his gluttonous master as a Jawa scurries over to Lando, takes the device Luke has constructed and delivers it to Jabba, who inspects it.
JABBA (in Huttese) A Durellian spice extractor.... Ask him how many?
THREEPIO (in English) He would like to know if you have any more, you are standing over a trap door.

LANDO Two hundred, a rare load, and a more than adequate ransom for Captain Solo.
Threepio repeats this to Jabba, who laughs and rubs his hands in glee.
JABBA (in Huttese) Agreed.
THREEPIO (in English) He has agreed to your ....
JABBA (in Huttese) Seize them!
Jabba signals his guards, who instantly grab Chewie and Lando securing their hands behind them.
JABBA (in Huttese) Now you will join your beloved Captain, and I will demand twice the ransom.
THREEPIO We’re doomed.
LANDO But, we must tell him your reply! If we don’t return, Skywalker will not deliver the goods.
Threepio repeats this to Jabba, who answers with a boisterous laugh. JABBA (in Huttese) If he fails to arrive, you will fail to survive. THREEPIO He doesn’t care.
LANDO What?! You can’t do this! Jabba, think of all the wealth you’re throwing away....
Lando and the Wookiee are led away amid laughter and jeers. Jabba’s goblet is refilled and he commands the entertainment to begin. Several GIRLS emerge from the crowd and start to dance.
20. DUNGEON HALLWAY AND CELL Lando and Chewie are led down the row of cells, passing Artoo pushing a broom. Chewie barks at his little friend and the stubby droid starts whistling madly. One of the guards pulls a controller from his belt and zaps Artoo with it. The little robot jumps and lets out a scream. A cell door opens and the two prisoners are thrown inside. The door bangs closed as Chewie smells someone else is in the cell with them. The giant Wookiee lets out a crazy yell and races toward a shadowed figure in the corner. He grabs the figure and gives him a big hug that carries them into the light revealing Chewie’s old partner, a bearded HAN SOLO.
HAN All right, all right, wait a second, you’re crushing me!
Chewie lets go and Han scratches the Wookiee’s chest and sees Lando.
HAN Lando! I’m gonna kill you.
He starts to take a swing at his old friend when Chewie comes between them holding Han back. The Wookiee growls and yips an explanation. Han relaxes.
HAN You rescued Chewie and Leia?

LANDO .... and now I’m here to rescue you.... HAN Well, you’re doing great so far.
LANDO Luke’s plan seems to have backfired. HAN Luke? He’s here too?
LANDO He will be soon enough.... He’s gonna try to pay off Jabba with some phony spice extractor that he doesn’t have.
HAN Is he crazy?
Chewie barks yes!
HAN That kid can’t even take care of himself, let alone rescue us. LANDO He seems awfully sure of himself.
21. EXT. ROAD TO PALACE GATE Luke, dressed in a black shirt and pants, walks down the dusty road toward the palace gate. He carries no pistol, and no lasersword. He stands before the gate and the little eye gives him the once over.
LUKE Open the gate, I am expected....
The gate creaks open and Luke enters.
22. INT. JABBA’S PALACE HALLWAY Two giant guards fall in behind Luke as he strides down the long hallway. Bib Fortuna appears out of the darkness and greets the young Jedi. Several other guards surround them in the darkness.
BIB His Excellency holds your agents as well as Capt. Solo. You must bring double the ransom you offered, and then Jabba will bargain.
LUKE (in Huttese) I would speak to Jabba, now!
BIB He will not see you. First you must bring the ransom.
Luke looks around at the guards and then back to Bib.
LUKE The ransom is unimportant.
BIB The ransom is unimportant.
LUKE You will take me to Jabba, now!
BIB I will take you to Jabba, now.
LUKE The guards will stay here.
BIB (in Huttese) Guards, stay here.
LUKE You will show me the way.
BIB I will show you the way.
Bib turns and Luke follows him into the darkness leaving the somewhat puzzled guards behind scratching their heads.
23. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER The loud and boisterous court of Jabba the Hutt suddenly goes quiet as Luke and Bib Fortuna enter the large chamber. Bib leans over to Jabba’s ear and whispers something. Jabba becomes upset and Bib backs away as the

gangster yells.
JABBA (in Huttese) Throw him out. He must bring the extractors first. The guards start for Luke, and he glares at them and they stop. Threepio edges his way through the crowds to see Luke.
THREEPIO Master Luke!
LUKE I must be allowed to speak, now.
BIB He must be allowed to speak now.
He returns and whispers this to Jabba, who becomes furious and clobbers Bib, sending him crashing to the floor.
JABBA (in Huttese) You weak-minded alien fool! He’s using an old Jedi mind trick.
LUKE (in Huttese) You will bring Capt. Solo to me.
JABBA (in Huttese) Young Jedi, I am not affected by Human thought. I’m afraid your mind powers will not work with me, boy. I have killed many Jedi Knights in my time....
Threepio notices that Luke is standing over the trap door and frantically motions him to move to one side.
THREEPIO Master Luke. He’s going to kill you, move away.... you’re standing on a....
A MONSTER turns around and growls at Threepio and he quickly shuts up and backs away.
JABBA I shall enjoy watching you die....
Luke reaches out his hand, and a pistol jumps out of one of the guards’ holsters, flying magically into Luke’s hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it.
JABBA Boscka!
The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the guard into the pit. Jabba laughs and the court joins in.
24. INT. RANCOR PIT Luke manages to get to his feet. The guard is yelling for help. The young Jedi looks up to see a crowd gathering around the edge of the pit and a metal gate slams closed above him. A second door in the side of the pit starts to rumble open. The guard panics and starts to scream. Luke calmly looks around for a means to escape. Out of the side passage emerges a giant brown fanged RANCOR. The guard finds his pistol and starts firing at the hideous beast; which only seems to make it more furious, as it comes at the two men.
In a sudden burst of energy, Luke jumps twenty feet straight up and grabs on to the overhead grate. The crowd is at first startled, and then starts booing at Luke, as he makes his way hand over hand to

the side wall, where he wedges himself into a corner. As the guard continues to fire at the monster, it picks up the unfortunate man and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few screams, and the guard has been swallowed. The audience’s cheers turn to jeers as Luke struggles to maintain his grip. His foot slips and he dangles helplessly over the howling beast.
25. INT. MAIN CHAMBER – PALACE Two filthy little Jawas run over to the grate and mash Luke’s fingers with the butts of their laser rifles. Luke struggles to hang on. He is unable to brace himself against the wall.
26. INT. RANCOR PIT The Rancor paws at Luke, but is unable to reach him. Finally, the Jawas are successful and Luke drops from the grate. The young Jedi lands in the eye of the monster, then tumbles to the floor of the pit. The Rancor bellows in pain, stamping around in circles holding his face. Luke runs behind the raging creature and scurries into the holding tunnel. Unfortunately, it’s a dead end, and he turns to see the monster approaching him. Luke notices a door mechanism about half way down the wall. He picks up a stone and hurtles it at the controls. A split second before the Rancor reaches Luke, the overhead door comes crashing down on the beast’s head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg – Luke tries to catch his breath.
27. INT. MAIN CHAMBER – PALACE A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court as all heads turn to Jabba, who is turning red with anger.
JABBA (in Huttese) Get him out of there.... and bring Solo and his friends! They will all suffer for this outrage.
The Rancor KEEPERS are the first ones into the pit followed by several guards. The keepers check the dead Rancor. One of the keepers breaks down and starts sobbing. He is comforted by the other keepers.
28. INT. DUNGEON CELL Han, Chewie and Lando crowd around little R2-D2 who is projecting a small hologram of Luke.
LUKE ....when the time is right.
HAN I don’t have much hope for this, but it’s the only chance we’ve got.
LANDO Don’t worry, Luke will come through.
R-2 beeps as noises are heard at the cell door. R-2 quickly sticks out his vacuum cleaner extension. The others assume casual positions around the cell before the contingent of guards enters and yanks the

prisoners out leaving little R-2 alone to finish his cleaning.
29. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER Han, Chewie, and Lando are shoved into the main chamber, where they are forced to kneel before Jabba the Hutt. They are surprised to see Threepio standing behind the grotesque gangster.
JABBA (in Huttese) Han, my boy, I had intended for your final performance to be at the festival.... I must admit I’m surprised at the company you keep....
THREEPIO He’s moving up your execution. He is quite upset at Master Luke.
LANDO I told you! He’s got the old geezer scared to death.
HAN All he’s managed to do is speed up our funeral.
LANDO (to Jabba) Our friend is powerful. He will destroy you. Threepio repeats this to Jabba, who laughs.
JABBA (in Huttese) Powerful, yes, but I doubt if he can destroy us. There is a commotion at the far end of the room, and Luke is escorted through the crowd, and placed with the others. He is slightly beat up from his ordeal with the Rancor. He looks sheepishly at his friends.
HAN Good try old buddy. Stupid, but at least you tried.
JABBA (in Huttese) I have a special treat for you, and your friends, Jedi. From this one you will not escape. Take them to the SARLACC NEST.
A loud cheer rises from the crowd, as they excitedly start to leave the room. Threepio’s interpretation of Jabba’s speech is drowned out by the noise. Chewie and the others look around somewhat worried.
30. EXT. TATOOINE DUNE SEA The sandstorm has subsided somewhat, as a huge SAIL BARGE cruises across the vast dune sea about six feet above the sand surface. This is a large version of Luke’s old anti-gravity landspeeder. Darting in and out among the large craft are several smaller SKIFFS; which hold about twenty people.
31. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive anti-gravity ship. His entire retinue is with him, drinking and eating and having a great time. Threepio stands between two horrible CREATURES, translating their conversation. Both monsters speak in strange tongues. One of the beasts gets angry at something the other has said, and punches him in the face. Threepio takes this as a sign to leave; which he does in haste, bumping into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby droid lets out an

angry series of beeps and whistles. Threepio finally recognizes the robot.
THREEPIO Artoo! What are you doing here?
Artoo beeps a quick reply.
THREEPIO Of course, I see you’re serving drinks! But, this place is dangerous, they’re going to execute Master Luke, and if we’re not careful, us too!
Artoo whistles a sing-song response.
THREEPIO I wish I had your confidence....
A slimy beast bellows at Artoo, holding up his goblet. R-2 beeps a good-bye and scoots over to the thirsty creature.
32. INT. SKIFF Han, Luke, Chewie and Lando sit in the small anti- gravity craft surrounded by armed guards.
HAN So much for your plan to get us out of the palace. Now we’re really in for it.
LANDO The odds don’t look too good.
LUKE Don’t worry, I’ll get us out of this.
HAN (sarcastic) Oh I’m sure.
LUKE Hey! I’ve learned a few things since I saw you last. Trust me old buddy.
HAN Pardon me, I forgot you’ve become a Jedi.
Han gives a skeptical glance at Lando, who shrugs, then at Chewie, who barks. Luke closes his eyes and relaxes.
33. EXT. DUNE SEA – SARLACC PIT The hovering barge stops on the side of a large sand pit. The smaller skiffs circle the rim of the deep cone of sand. The craft carrying Luke, Han, Lando and Chewie moves over the center of the pit and hovers. The prisoners look down into the pit and see a disgusting mucus lined hole at the vortex of sand. Around the edge of the cavity are thousands of needle sharp teeth and four thin, ten foot long feelers, that sweep across the sand looking for victims.
34. INT. SKIFF Chewie growls at the monster in the pit. Han and Lando look at Luke with worried looks. The guards order the prisoners to stand, and they are lined up in the center of the small craft. A long gangplank is hoisted to the side of the hovering skiff.
35. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE The crowd is getting drunk and boisterous. A tall thin BRUTE pours the remains of his drink on Artoo’s head and demands a refill, which he is given by the little droid with a subservient beep. Jabba laughs hysterically as two beautiful young GIRLS toss small fruits into his mouth. Bib Fortuna settles

down next to the Exalted One and motions to the skiff hovering over the pit.
BIB We are ready, Your Excellency.
Jabba raises his arm, and the motley array of intergalactic pirates falls silent. Threepio is standing right behind him and he motions to the robot.
JABBA Protocol droid!
Threepio leans forward, right next to Jabba’s face and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. Threepio steps forward to the rail overlooking the pit and the small skiff.
THREEPIO His Excellency hopes you will die honorably, but should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the Exalted One will now listen to your pleas.
The prisoners look at each other and Han steps forward.
HAN You can tell that slimy, worm-ridden filth, he will get no such pleasure from us.
Threepio repeats this in Huttese to Jabba, who only laughs, and gives the thumbs down sign.
JABBA Put them in!
36. INT. SKIFF Two guards grab Luke and roughly lead him to the waiting gangplank. They release his magno-bonds, and force him to walk out over the pit by poking him with long electronic poles. A guard timidly moves out on the gangplank to push Luke out to the end. The young Jedi turns to face his companions and then salutes them. LUKE I guess this could have ended better. See yah, old buddy.
The guard prods him again and he jumps off the gangplank to the cheers of the bloodthirsty spectators. Before anyone realizes what happened, Luke has used his Jedi training to spin around, grab onto the end of the plank, and catapult himself up onto the deck with a double-back flip; which causes the startled guard to lose his balance and fall into the pit.
Luke reaches out his hand and a blaster is pulled from the holster of one of the guards and magically flips into his hand. Now things are happening very fast. The hapless guard in the pit is eaten as a second guard draws his pistol, but is blasted by Luke before he can fire. The rest of the guards go for their weapons, and chaos follows. Hands bound, Han, Chewie and Lando dive for cover. Luke grabs a bonding release device and activates it. The prisoners’ restraining bonds fall away.
The guards fire at Luke as he races to the control panel of the craft,

but the guns are knocked out of their hands by Han and Lando. Chewie grabs one of the guards and tosses him overboard into the waiting jaws of the sarlacc. A fist fight ensues between prisoners and guards. Two guards knock Luke away from the skiff controls and the hover craft begins to drift. Using his Jedi skills, Luke knocks the two guards overboard, but one manages to grab onto a rail and dangles over the pit screaming. Luke is hit from behind by another guard and knocked to the deck.
37. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE Jabba and the spectators are startled at the turn of events. Some of the creatures begin to laugh and yell at the combatants. Jabba is amused. Bib is worried.
BIB (in Huttese) Should I stop it, Your Excellency?
JABBA No wait, I find it amusing.
Guards take up positions along the gunnel of the barge as the fistfight continues to rage on the small skiff. Threepio has backed away from the main group of spectators, hoping not to be noticed. He is startled by Artoo, who comes up from behind, and lets out a loud hoot. Threepio jumps and turns around.
THREEPIO Artoo! Don’t do that! What is it?
Artoo lets out with a series of whistles and beeps, then takes off down the deck.
THREEPIO You need my help? Wait, I don’t understand, what plan? Artoo?
Threepio follows his stubby companion into the hold of the barge. Three guards fight with Luke, and Han, Lando and Chewie fight the remaining three guards. The Captain of the Guard is beckoned over to Jabba by Bib.
JABBA Shoot them.
CAPTAIN Your Excellency, six of my guards are down there. It will difficult to get off a clear shot.
JABBA Shoot them all!
CAPTAIN (distressed) Yes, Your Excellency.
The Captain bows, and commands his men to fire at the skiff.
38. INT. SKIFF Laserbolts wizz past the combatants. The guard fighting with Chewie is hit by a blast, and the Wookiee is knocked to the deck wounded. Another blast hits the controls of the skiff, knocking out one of the stabilizers, causing the small craft to lurch violently to one side thirty degrees, throwing Han, Luke and many of the guards into the Sarlacc pit. Two of the guards, Lando, and the wounded Wookiee manage to hang on to the lopsided craft.

Laserbolts continue to bounce off the bottom of the skiff protecting those still on board the craft. A guard who was hanging on the side during the fight suddenly finds himself on top of the craft. He is able to stand and wave frantically at the guards on the barge to stop firing. The second guard struggles to pull himself up to the control panel. Lando who is hanging on the top rail works his way along hand over hand trying to get to the controls before the guard. Chewie is caught between two seats and bellows in pain.
39. EXT. SARLACC Han struggles to climb out of the pit, but only slides further down toward the fearsome sloth. He slides past Luke who is lying very still, spread eagle in the sand, facing the hole at the bottom.
LUKE Han, lie still, don’t fight it.
HAN It’s easy for you to say.
Luke reaches out and grabs onto Han as he slides past him. Han’s momentum is stopped, both of them are pulled closer to the horrible mouth. The guards struggle frantically, and are quickly eaten.
40. INT. CONTROL BRIDGE OF SAIL BARGE Artoo and Threepio race into the small control room of the barge whistling and yelling. THREEPIO (in Huttese) We’re under attack! They’re going to kill His Excellency. Help him, hurry!
The BARGE CAPTAIN and his two PILOTS rush out of the bridge and Artoo quickly closes the door behind them and locks it with a loud click.
THREEPIO This is a great plan, now we’re trapped.
Artoo beeps a rude response and goes to the control panel and starts pushing a long row of red buttons. An alarm suddenly goes off. THREEPIO You’ve just opened all the power connectors. You’re going to blow us up!
Banging begins at the locked door as the crew responds to the alarms.
41. INT. SKIFF Lando just barely makes it to the controls before the guard flips the switch that rights the ship, throwing the other guard standing on its side, into the pit. Lando and the guard fight over the controls causing the ship to lurch. Chewie slides dangerously close to the open hatch, but with great pain manages to hold on.
42. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE The guards who are firing at the skiff are ordered away by their Captain.
CAPTAIN (in Huttese) To the control bridge, quickly!
Jabba remains calm, but those around him begin to panic and some

run. The muffled alarm sounds can be heard from the control bridge as the huge barge begins to shudder.
43. SARLACC PIT Lando finally knocks the last guard into the pit and takes control of the craft. Han and Luke slide closer to the jaws. One of the sloth’s feelers wraps itself around Han’s leg and starts to pull both warriors into its deadly mouth. Lando maneuvers the skiff down toward his two friends and lowers a tow cable. Luke and Han try to grab the cable, but only slip closer to death. Lando moves the ship around for another try. Chewie lies unconscious in the back of the craft.
44. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE The beating sounds are intense and the door starts to give way. Artoo and 3PO stand on the control panel in front of a window. Artoo beeps at Threepio as he hesitates at the window.
THREEPIO I can’t do it....
Artoo beeps and bumps 3PO through the window. The golden robot shrieks as he falls to the sand below. R-2 jumps after him, just as the door explodes and several guards burst into the control bridge. CAPTAIN Shut down those converters!
The guards race to the control panel.
45. SARLACC PIT – BARGE Han is almost touching the needle sharp teeth as Lando moves the cable within reach a second time. Luke grabs on to the cable and the two warriors are pulled from the pit as the cable is slowly retracted.
Bib moves closer to his master and whispers into his ear.
BIB Perhaps the deck gun would be helpful, Exalted One.
JABBA What are those alarms?
BIB Not to worry, everything is under control.
JABBA Fire the deck guns!
The guards rush to several large deck guns mounted near the bow of the barge.
Luke finally makes it to the deck of the skiff and helps Han on board. A blast from the barge deck gun rocks the small craft almost knocking Han overboard. He dangles from the side rail and is almost knocked loose by a second blast which causes the ship to lean to one side. Lando struggles to right the craft and get them out of there.
LANDO We’re losing power, another direct hit and we’re finished. The guards are zeroed in on the skiff when the Captain and his men run out of the control bridge yelling.
CAPTAIN Abandon ship! Abandon ship.

Before the guards can react, the entire barge blows up in a spectacular fire works display; which jostles the small skiff quite violently, throwing both Luke and Lando to the deck and almost causing Han to drop.
The flaming barge drops into the sand pit, throwing Jabba, Bib and company into the waiting jaws of the sloth. Lando gains control of the skiff and stabilizes the craft as Luke pulls Han on board.
46. EXT. DUNE SEA In the distance the burning wreckage of the barge explodes a second time as a small periscope pops out of the sand in the middle of a crater. Muffled beeps are heard and the periscope looks around until it sees two golden feet sticking out of the sand not far away. A large shadow moves over the droids, and a voice is heard.
LUKE Artoo! Artoo up here.
The periscope looks up and sees the bottom of the skiff hovering above. Luke is leaning over one side of the craft lowering a cable and large magnet toward the sunken droid. In the skiff Han is helping Chewie to sit up, and is applying some first aid to the Wookiee’s wounded shoulder. The furry beast winces and growls at Han.
HAN I know it hurts. Just lay still.
Lando tries to maintain the skiff over the droids. The magnet is attached to R-2′s head and he is slowly raised toward the craft. A second magnet attaches to the two golden feet, and pulls Threepio out of the sand.
THREEPIO Oh, my head!
R-2, still dangling below the skiff beeps to his companion. THREEPIO Well, you should be sorry.
R-2 coos a sorry sigh as the skiff begins to pull away and head across the dune sea.
47. EXT. FOREST HAD ABBADON MOON – BALL
GUN Camouflaged Land Speeders lift a large gun barrel into position atop a huge ball shaped ion cannon. Leia and a REBEL COMMANDER walk out of a low control bunker. The gun and control area are in the process of being camouflaged by work crews and other landspeeders.
CAPTAIN JODE We should have it completely covered by nightfall. The Empire can’t possibly find us then.
LEIA When you’ve finished, keep your men inside. Wait until the moon has made one full rotation before you target the shield generator.

CAPTAIN JODE If that generator’s creating a shield powerful enough to protect those Death Stars, it’s not going to be that easy to knock out.
LEIA That’s why you have to line up precisely on the central tower. CAPTAIN JODE But, it’s too big for one of these size guns to do any damage....
LEIA If the shield around those Death Stars is still operational when the fleet attacks, they won’t have a chance. WE have to knock it out. I’m going back to the ship, to signal the fleet that we’re ready. CAPTAIN JODE As soon as we have the target lined up, I’ll contact you.
Leia gets into a camouflaged armored landspeeder, and takes off into the dense forest. Captain Jode shakes his head, then goes back to his work.
48. INT. DARTH VADER’S STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE Vader stands on the bridge of his Star Destroyer looking out across the half completed Death Stars. Admiral Piett approaches him.
PIETT Yes, my Lord?
VADER Where is the Grand Moff Jerjerrod?
PIETT He is in the private communication chamber.
VADER He is speaking with the Emperor?
PIETT I’m not sure, all surveillance in the room has been cut off.... and his coded transmission is undecipherable. He’s using a special code, I have come across nothing like it before.
VADER Have the extra patrols arrived on the sanctuary moon? PIETT Yes my Lord, GENERAL VEERS has taken command himself. VADER Inform me when the Grand Moff has finished his communication.
Vader turns his attention back to the Death Stars. Piett leaves.
49. INT. VADER’S STAR DESTROYER – COMMUNICATION CHAMBER The Grand Moff Jerjerrod kneels before a huge holographic image of the Emperor.
THE EMPEROR Take extra precautions. He is far stronger than his father.
JERJERROD Yes, Master. We will have the boy quite soon.
THE EMPEROR Vader is to know nothing of this. Young Skywalker must be brought directly to me. Do you understand?
JERJERROD Yes Master.
THE EMPEROR .... and watch Lord Vader closely. He is powerful and not to be underestimated.

JERJERROD Yes Master. He will be quite distracted. The Rebel attack is proceeding as you planned, and Lord Vader already suspects their presence. He has sent several units to the sanctuary moon.
THE EMPEROR Good. Everything is falling into place.
JERJERROD It is as you have foreseen, my Master.
The Grand Moff bows low, and [the] supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Jerjerrod and fades away.
50. FOREST HAD ABBADON MOON A squad of nimble one-man Imperial rocket bikes speed around the giant trees of the medieval forest. The ominous crunching sounds of huge metallic feet are a counterpoint to the high-pitched scream of the Rocket Bikes. Finally, out of the mist the monstrous shape of a two-legged Imperial walker appears. The sinister machine slowly makes its way through the dense foliage as the tiny Scout Bikes dart to and fro.
51. INT. IMPERIAL WALKER Two Imperial pilots sit at the controls in front of the main viewing port. General Veers stands to one side, watching a radar scope. One of the pilots turns toward the general. PILOT Sir, we’re approaching what appears to be a downed transport.
VEERS Send the scouts ahead....
PILOT I’ve picked up a small grouping of life forms.
VEERS Check the registry.
PILOT Sir, our scouts are under attack!
52. EXT. FOREST LANDING SITE – TRANSPORT A small battle is raging around the Imperial Transport as the giant walker moves into the clearing. A few powerful blasts from the deadly machine, and the fighting stops.
53. EXT. HANGAR – HUTT SPACEPORT – SANDSTORM –
DAY Lando leads Luke, Han, Chewie and the robots through a raging sandstorm toward the entrance to an underground starship hangar. LANDO It’s not much further.
HAN I just hope you parked her out of this storm.
Chewie barks to his old friend that he picked the spot.
HAN Good work Chewie.
They make it to the shelter of the hangar entrance. Lando and Chewie trundle down the flight of stairs, as Han stops Luke just inside the doorway.
HAN Luke....
LUKE I’d better wait for the droids.

HAN Listen Luke. I’m not much good at these things, but I just want to say thanks. We’re even.... I’m sorry I doubted you....You have learned a lot....
Luke laughs, and pats his old friend on the back.
LUKE Just a few tricks....
HAN Luke....Ah about Leia....I
LUKE I know everything. She loves you Han. My feelings for her are different than yours. I’m not going to get in your way.
Han gives Luke a big hug as Threepio stumbles up to the entryway. He looks a little worse for wear.
THREEPIO Master Luke, Master Luke! They’ve taken Artoo....
LUKE What? Where?
THREEPIO (pointing) Back there.... two men, grabbed him. They’ll strip him for parts.
Han and Luke dash out of the entryway and into the full blast of the sandstorm.
54. EXT. ALLEYWAY HUTT SPACEPORT – SANDSTORM.
They run down an alleyway looking for Artoo. The sand blows furiously around them.
LUKE This way.
HAN I can’t see a thing...wait over there.
Han points at two cloaked figures disappearing down a narrow passageway and starts after them. Luke follows. As Han rounds the corner, he is struck over the head by a powerful blow from behind. He hits the ground with a thud revealing little Artoo, helplessly dangling from a strap tied halfway up the wall. One of the figures puts a hand over the little droid’s mouth.
1′ST FIGURE Get ready, here he comes.
Luke rounds the corner, sees Han, Artoo, and is instantly surrounded by a cage that suddenly appears around him.
OFFICER Get his weapon.
Luke looks around and sees that he is trapped. He touches the bars of his cage, they’re electrified. His blaster is drawn out of his holster, and crashes against the magnetic bars.
OFFICER Hurry, get him aboard the ship.
55. EXT. HANGAR – HUTT SPACEPORT SANDSTORM
Chewie and Lando join Threepio at the entrance to the Hangar. LANDO What’s going on?
THREEPIO They went to rescue Artoo. He was...
Chewie barks and points at Artoo and Han struggling through the

sandstorm. Chewie and Lando go out to help Han.
HAN They’ve taken Luke...
The loud roar of a starship taking off can be heard overhead. They all look up as it passes and fades in the distance.
HAN Quick, we’ve got to go after them.
56. HUTT SPACEPORT – DAY
The Millenium Falcon roars off its’ landing pad and quickly disappears into the sandstorm.
57. INT. COCKPIT – FALCON
Han and Chewie are at the controls and Lando and the robots sit in the back. Chewie barks and flips a switch.
HAN Yeah, that’s them all right. We can outrun them easy.
LANDO Unless...
Out the cockpit window, the Imperial shuttle is very close when suddenly it rockets away at a terrific rate of speed, and disappears. LANDO (continued) ... they go to lightspeed.
Chewie pushes forward on the throttle and the Falcon slows. Han bangs his fist on the controls in anger.
HAN Blast it!
LANDO Chewie, set your coordinates for the fleet...
The Falcon rockets away into the stars.
58. HAD ABBADON MOON – IMPERIAL TRANSPORT
A couple of Rebel troops mill around the Imperial transport as two speeders enter the clearing and stop. Several more troops exit the huge spacecraft. Leia and CAPT. KAUN climb out of the speeders. Leia turns to one of the Rebel troops.
LEIA Put them inside for the night.
They walk toward the transport.
LEIA Now all we have to do is sit and wait. You know, it’s strange, but I don’t recognize any of these men.
CAPTAIN KAUN That’s funny, neither do I.
A sudden realization crosses over their faces. They grab for their weapons, and run back toward the speeder. The Rebel troops start to fire at them and they dive behind one of the speeders. Out of the forest rise four Imperial scouts on rocket bikes. Leia blasts one of them and the bike crashes to the ground. The second speeder explodes, knocking two more of the rocket bikes to the ground. Kaun runs over to the bike and takes off, quickly followed by Leia on the second bike. The troops fire at them as they escape. General Veers comes out of the hold of the transport.

VEERS After them!
Four more scouts race from behind the transport on the rocket bikes. The General turns to one of his officers.
VEERS Contact the fleet and inform Lord Vader we’ve got two on the run, and are following them back to the others.
59. HAD ABBADON MOON – FOREST
Leia and Captain Kaun dangerously maneuver their tiny rocket bikes between the mammoth trees at speeds of two hundred miles per hour. They are closely followed by four other scouts, who occasionally fire at them. Explosions echo throughout the forest as laser bolts rip into the trees. The two Rebels ride out over a ridge and slowly float down to the forest below. The Imperial scouts follow in a hair-raising chase that bounces over hills, through narrow gullies, and in between trees. One of the Imperial scouts loses control and explodes against a tree.
Captain Kaun has dropped a little behind Leia and blasted by one of the troops, causing him to crash. Now Leia is alone, being chased by three Imperial scouts. She rounds a narrow bend and a rope net suddenly shoots up in front of her, catching her bike and sending it head over heels. Leia lands unconscious on some soft leaves. The three scouts race around the bend and aren’t so lucky. The first bike hits the net and the other two plow into it causing a big explosion, which engulfs the three scouts.
Leia remains unconscious as the explosion fades away.
60. EXT. REBEL FLEET
The Falcon arrives at the Rebel fleet and docks with one of the huge Star Cruisers.
61. INT. MAIN BAY REBEL HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT
Han, Chewie, Lando and the robots enter the main bay of the Rebel Cruiser and are greeted by Capt. New and several of his officers. Han looks around for Leia.
CAPT. NEW You made it back just in time.
LANDO In time for what?
CAPT. NEW All units have been called together for one massive attack against Had Abbadon. Where is Commander Skywalker?
HAN Did I hear you right? Had Abbadon, the Imperial Capitol? Whose crazy idea was that? Where is she anyway? Where’s Leia? LANDO Luke has been captured, we came to get help to find him. CAPT. NEW We’ve already started the staging procedures for the attack. The General will want you with us.

HAN Now wait a second. Where is Leia?
Capt. New and his officer exchange worried looks.
CAPT. NEW We’d better get you to the General for a briefing.
62. WAR ROOM – REBEL HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT
The large war room is a hurricane of activity. Commanders stand in small groups before large briefing screens as control officer rush about exchanging information and getting things ready. Standing before a large electronic table is GENERAL MADINE, Captain New, Han, Lando, Chewie and the robots. A planet and its satellites are shown on the table display and as the General talks about a subject, it lights up or an arrow points to it.
GENERAL MADINE ... And using a captured Imperial transport, she has succeeded in establishing an ion cannon on the moon sanctuary of Had Abbadon.
LANDO ... Which could knock out the shield generator, making those Death Stars vulnerable to a cruiser attack.
Han shakes his head at this crazy plan. Chewie barks.
HAN I think this whole plan is nuts. Lando, you’re a tactics expert, what are their chances?
LANDO It’s been a long time since I’ve played this game. The odds aren’t too good...
HAN You’re telling me!
LANDO ... But if the fleet could be brought out of hyperspace on this side of the moon, it could just work. Now the timing will have to be very accurate...
HAN Great, that’s all they need to hear. General Madine, meet General Calrissian. You can stay here and play soldier if you want, I’m leaving. Come on, Chewie.
LANDO Han, wait! Where are you going?
HAN I’m going to that sanctuary moon, and I’m going to get Leia out of there, then we’re going to find Luke.
MADINE She’ll never go with you.
LANDO You’ll never find him that way.
HAN Wanna bet! Vader’s got him.
Han turns and walks away, followed by Chewie. Lando turns to the General and shakes his head.
LANDO And he thinks this plan is crazy...he’ll never get near that moon.
Artoo and Threepio race after Han and Chewie as they leave the room.

THREEPIO Hey! Wait for us!
63. EXT. REBEL FLEET – SPACE
The Falcon roars off of the landing platform into space.
64. INT. FALCON COCKPIT
Han and Chewie operate the controls of the modified freighter. The giant Wookiee barks a long-winded question.
HAN Of course I have a plan... If I can just calculate the light speed coordinates close enough, we should come out of hyperspace right above the moon’s surface. We’ll have landed before they notice a thing.
Chewie chatters an animated reply. Threepio looks at Artoo.
HAN I know, I know, one millidigit too far and we’re so much space dust. But there’s no other way, so hang on!
Han pulls back on the lightspeed throttle and the stars streak out the cockpit window. The Falcon zooms away into hyperspace in less than a second.
65. HAD ABBADON MOON – FOREST
A strange little furry face with huge yellow eyes slowly comes into focus. The creature is an EWOK, named WICKET, and he seems somewhat puzzled as he looks at the waking Princess. Leia groans, which frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he stumbles backward, falling on his tail with a loud squeak. Leia sits up and stares at the three foot high Ewok, trying to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her clothes are badly torn and she is fairly beat up.
The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four foot long spear which he holds in a defensive position. Leia watches him carefully as he circles her, poking occasionally with his sharp spear.
LEIA Hey, cut that out. Don’t be afraid little fella, I won’t hurt you.
She stands up and the Ewok quickly backs away. She walks over to the remains of the destroyed rocket bikes and surveys the wreckage and notices what little remains of the rope net that stopped her. She pulls a part of the rope down and studies it.
LEIA I’m afraid you caught more than you bargained for... what a mess.
The little Ewok grabs the net out of her hands and starts scolding her in a funny language made up of squeaks and barks. He points at the wreckage, then to the net, throws up his hands and marches around in little circles, obviously upset at what Leia has done to his trap. LEIA Calm down. My transport isn’t in such great shape either...
Leia looks around at the dense forest, then with a sigh, she sits on a

fallen log.
LEIA And to top it off, I think I’m lost.
The fuzzy little Ewok sits on a smaller log next to Leia. He puts his head in his hands with a great sigh. Leia scratches the little creature on the head.
LEIA Cheer up, things could be worse.
A loud snap and rustle of leaves is heard in the distance as the Ewok’s ears perk up, and he begins to sniff the air.
LEIA What is it?
The Ewok lets out a loud screech, and starts to run, but a laser blast explodes right in front of the little creature. Leia draws her pistol and jumps behind the log. A second flash comes out of the foliage and explodes in front of the log. Leia returns the fire, senses something and turns around to see two large Imperial Stormtroopers standing over her with their guns pointed at her head. The scout officer reaches out his hand for her weapon.
SCOUT OFFICER I’ll take that...
She hands her pistol over to the brutish officer as he turns to the second scout.
SCOUT OFFICER (continued) Contact General Veers and tell him that we’ve found one of them.
Leia moves over in front of the little Ewok, and pushes him further under the log. The second scout goes back to where his rocket bike is hidden in the foliage. A third scout rides his back into the clearing and dismounts. The officer pulls Leia over to the third scout and roughly shoves her at him, then starts back to where his bike is hidden.
The third scout takes out a pair of binders, and starts to put them on Leia’s wrists. A shrill scream is heard on the far side of the clearing. The scout looks over to see the officer holding Wicket, the Ewok, by one arm. Wicket swings at the trooper in vain.
OFFICER I think we’ve found another one.
Taking advantage of the guards’ distraction, Leia brings her bound fists straight up hard into the scout’s chin, knocking him unconscious. She dives for her laser pistol as the scout officer drops the Ewok and goes for his gun. Leia beats him to the draw and blasts him away. The second guard rides into the clearing, but his bike is hit by one of Leia’s laser blasts and is knocked end over tail. The forest is quiet once more. Wicket pokes his furry little head up from behind the log, still a little dazed, and mumbling about what happened. Leia comes

over to the chubby little Ewok and pulls him away into the dense foliage.
LEIA Come on, we’ve got to get out of here.
As they run into the foliage, Wicket shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow him.
66. SPACE – HAD ABBADON
An Imperial shuttle roars over camera and heads for the polluted brown planet of Had Abbadon. It passes the green sanctuary moon, the Death Stars and Vader’s fleet.
67. INT. COCKPIT – IMPERIAL SHUTTLE
Two pilots operate the shuttle as an officer sits behind them. OFFICER Steer clear of the fleet. The Emperor doesn’t want Lord Vader to sense the boy’s presence.
68. INT. HOLD – SHUTTLE
Luke sits in a small metallic cell inside the hold of the shuttle. His head is in his hands.
LUKE Ben, help me...come to me, please Ben. I’m not strong enough to face my father. Help me to resist the Dark Side of the Force. Ben, Ben, please...
Luke looks up to see a shimmering, translucent image of Yoda standing in the tiny cell with him. Leia is startled by the vision.
LUKE Yoda?
YODA Ben can no longer help you. His power to stay in the netherworld has been spent. He will soon be one with the Force. His identity lost forever.
LUKE No, help him. Bring him back...
YODA Only you can draw him back to the material world. Stop your anger.
LUKE How, I can’t...
YODA You can’t, because that is what you think. Have you learned nothing?
LUKE Master, I...
YODA You cannot help Obi-Wan! You cannot face your father! You cannot resist the Dark Side! The Emperor has already won.
LUKE I’m sorry, I...
YODA Sorry will not save you...or Obi-Wan...or your father destroy. LUKE I have no will to destroy my father...there must be some good in him, I can feel it.
YODA Destroy you he will, as he destroyed himself...this you must face...

LUKE I am not strong enough, I will fail.
YODA If that is the way you feel...then I must turn to another for help. LUKE Another? Who?
YODA The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line. If you will not destroy your father, there is only one other left who can...your sister. LUKE Sister!!! I don’t have a sister.
YODA Strong with the Force is she; but untrained.
LUKE My sister?
YODA Taken to Alderaan by your mother, was she. Safer it was to keep you apart.
LUKE Leia?!?
YODA Your twin sister... If you fail to destroy your father, our only hope is she.
Luke is stunned by this bit of information, and quickly becomes lost in thought.
69. EXT. SPACE – HAD ABBADON
The tiny shuttle rockets toward the planet of Had Abbadon.
70. INT. FALCON – COCKPIT
Han quickly works the controls of the Falcon as Chewie barks a question.
HAN You’re right. I’ll reverse the polarity as soon as we’re out of hyperspace. Better strap yourself in Goldenrod, this could be a little rough.
Threepio gives Artoo a quick glance. The stubby little droid beeps a short observation.
THREEPIO That’s all right, Artoo, we don’t need to know the odds. HAN Here we go.
Han pulls forward on the light speed throttle. The black void out the cockpit window begins to streak with light and then the streaks become stars. Within a second or two, one of the stars rapidly grows into a planet; which appears to engulf the ship. The cockpit begins to shudder, then shake violently. Chewie barks and Artoo beeps. Han struggles to work the controls.
HAN Chewie, we’re in the atmosphere, throw on the brake!
71. MOON ATMOSPHERE
The Millenium Falcon glows like a comet as it streaks toward the planet surface.
72. SUPER STAR DESTROYER – BRIDGE
Lord Vader is standing before the massive windows on the bridge. The huge rim of the moon can be seen out one side of the window,

and the spidery superstructure of a Death Star can be seen out the other. Vader studies the streaking comet as it disappears onto the moon surface. CAPTAIN NAFFER, in the control pit, is startled by something on one of his readouts.
CAPTAIN NAFFER We’ve picked up a ship coming out of hyperspace. It appears to have collided with the moon.
VADER I saw it. Pinpoint the impact sight and tell General Veers to investigate immediately.
Vader notices Jerjerrod studying him from an alcove in the distance, as the captain hurries to implement his orders.
73. MOON FOREST – CLEARING
The ramp lowers on the smoking Falcon, and Han, Chewie and the robots exit the craft.
THREEPIO I don’t think I want to try that again.
Chewie barks his agreement.
HAN Come on, we’ve got no time to lose. The transport should be over this way.
Han makes his way into the foliage, closely followed by the rest of the group.
74. CAVE ENTRANCE – MOON FOREST
Wicket leads Leia along a narrow shaky wooden walkway, high in the giant trees. He stops at the end of the rickety walkway; which drops away to nothing. Far below is a clearing. On the other side of the clearing is a mountain with a sheer rock face. The Ewok points and Leia nods. Wicket grabs a long vine tied to the walkway. It is attached high above them in the trees. He hands Leia the vine and she grabs hold, he takes hold of the lower part of the vine. The little Ewok lets out a squeak and they swing across the clearing and into the cave. 75. INT. CAVE – EWOK VILLAGE
Leia follows Wicket through a small cave that opens into a large cavern. Along one wall of the cavern, a small village has been built under an outcropping of rocks. They enter the village which seems to be deserted, but Leia notices numerous little eyes peering out of the darkened doorway.
Wicket stops before the largest hut in the small square, and calls out something. A second Ewok, called TEEBO, comes out of the hut and confers with Wicket. They point periodically at Leia, and then Teebo goes back into the building. Wicket motions for Leia to follow, and they both go into the hut.
76. INT. CHIEF’S HUT

A glowing fire dances in the middle of the Spartan, low ceilinged room, causing a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Leia sits on the ground before Wicket and Teebo. In the darkness across the room, a group of about ten Ewoks sit around a slightly larger gray- haired Ewok; CHIEF CHIRPA. The rhythmic beat of a skin drum begins as the Ewok sitting next to Chief Chirpa begins to chant. This is LOGRAY, the medicine man of the tribe. Wicket stands and chatters to the Chief, then sits again. The rest of the Ewoks begin to chant as Logray approaches Leia.
The haunting chant and the bizarre surroundings have a hypnotic effect on the Princess. The trance is broken when the medicine man stands before her, and suddenly her hands are pinned to the ground by Wicket and Teebo. The chanting and drums stop as Logray grabs Leia’s head and yanks open her mouth, seemingly inspecting her teeth. He then looks at her eyes and ears. Finally he lets go and barks something to the assembly. The Chief replies to the medicine man and the drums begin to beat again.
Logray takes a bowl of ugly looking brew and offers it to Leia. Wicket and Teebo release her hands. She is a little leery about taking the foul smelling soup. Wicket quietly says something to her. She finally gets up the courage to taste it. It’s good, and she drinks the entire bowl to the screeching and barking cheers of the assembly. Wicket jumps up and hugs Leia, as do several other of the fuzzy little Ewoks. Leia’s tension fades away amid the joyous celebration of the furry little creatures.
77. LANDING AREA – HAD ABBADON
The ramp of the Imperial shuttle lowers, and Imperial troops line up outside the spacecraft. A captain of the Royal Guard, and about a dozen of his men march up to the shuttle as six stormtroopers escort the heavily bound young Jedi down the ramp. The officer speaks to one of the stormtroopers.
GUARD OFFICER Did he give you much trouble? STORMTROOPER None at all.
The guard officer studies Luke closely.
GUARD OFFICER He appears to be in good condition. The Emperor will be pleased. Take him.
The sergeant of the guard barks a command and all of the troops turn and march into the massive Imperial palace of Had Abbadon.
78. MAIN HALLWAY – IMPERIAL PALACE – HAD ABBADON
Luke and his escort follow the officer down a vast hallway lined with

Royal Guards. A group of star fleet captains stop their conversation and watch the prisoner as he passes. The captains recognize Luke and whisper among themselves until the squad of guards is far in the distance.
1ST CAPTAIN I’m sure it’s him.
2ND CAPTAIN Inform Lord Vader.
79. THRONE ROOM – HAD ABBADON
They enter a vast throne room, and stop. The guards line up behind Luke and snap to attention. On the far side of the room is a long, wide flight of stairs that leads to a throne that is silhouetted by a huge window behind it.
Sitting on the throne is a small, shrouded figure. This is the Emperor. Supreme Ruler of the Galactic Empire, and Master of the Dark Side of the Force. His voice echoes through the huge throne room. EMPEROR Come forward, young Jedi.
Luke walks forward until he is at the foot of the stairs then stops, trying to get a look at the silhouetted figure on the throne.
EMPEROR Yes, you are much like your father. Strong with the Force. You will make a powerful ally.
LUKE You cannot turn me to the Dark Side you did my father... EMPEROR I did not turn him to the Dark Side. That is something he did for himself...as you will do for yourself.
LUKE Never!
EMPEROR We will see. Take him to the tombs.
The guards rush up behind Luke and escort him away.
80. EXT. FOREST LANDING SIGHT – TRANSPORT
The transport is deserted, and the clearing appears tranquil as Han, Chewie and the robots survey the situation from a hiding place in the dense underbrush. Han takes out his com-link.
THREEPIO Looks peaceful enough.
HAN (into com-link) Blue Two, this is Red One. Do you copy?
VOICE (on com-link) Loud and clear. What are you doing here?
HAN Just waiting for your confirmation. Is Leia with you?
VOICE (on com-link) Sure enough. She’s in the back.
HAN Let’s go!
Before he can get up, he is stopped by Chewie who barks his concern.
HAN Well, it seems all right to me.
Han gets up and starts into the clearing, closely followed by Chewie and the others. They arrive at the main hatch of the Imperial

transport, and Han stops Chewie.
HAN Let me go first. Wait here.
Chewie shrugs as Han cautiously enters the transport hold.
81. INT. TRANSPORT HOLD
The vast hold is empty, except for a couple of Rebel speeders. He starts to walk toward the speeders, when two Imperial scouts come up behind him with their guns drawn.
SCOUT #3 That’s far enough! Rebel scum.
Han freezes. Outside, laser blasts and a lot of yelling can be heard. Threepio can barely be heard in the distance.
THREEPIO Captain Solo, it’s a trap!
SCOUT #3 Now turn around.
Han turns in a split second, draws his gun and blasts the two Imperial scouts before they can fire.
82. EXT. FOREST LANDING SIGHT – TRANSPORT
The clearing is chaos as Han exits the transport. Imperial scouts are blasting away at Chewie and the robots who are hidden behind some trees on the far side of the clearing. The scouts have their back to the transport.
HAN Chewie, run for it!!!
Several of the scouts turn toward Han, but are blasted away by the smuggler before they can fire. Chewie and the robots dash into the underbrush. The scouts are unable to follow them, because their attention has been focused on Han who is firing away at them. They scramble for cover as a monstrous two-legged walker enters the clearing and starts firing at Han, causing huge explosions all around him. He makes a break for the trees, but is cut off by an explosion. Han dives for cover under the landing gear of the transport. As the giant walker moves in on him, he makes another dash for the woods, and this time he makes it. Han races through the trees as the sounds of the huge walker’s feet pound behind him.
83. EXT. RAIN FOREST MOON
Han and Chewie are huffing and puffing as they meet up near a large tree. In the distance, the robots can be heard coming through the foliage. Chewie barks.
HAN I think we lost them, Chewie.
The robots make their way out of the underbrush. Artoo beeps. THREEPIO (to Han) Artoo’s sensor indicates the walker is moving away from us.
HAN This turned into a bigger mess than I expected. We’ve got to

find that ion cannon. Leia’s sure to be there, if she hasn’t been captured.
Threepio notices a stick in the ground next to Artoo, with several shanks of raw meat hanging from it.
THREEPIO Hello, what’s this? It looks like someone’s dinner.
Han and Chewie go over to see what it is they’ve found. Chewie reaches for one of the meat shanks.
HAN No wait!! Don’t touch it -
But it is too late, the hungry Wookiee has already pulled one of the pieces of meat off of the stick. A loud “sproing” is heard and the group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a screech and Chewie barks.
HAN Chewie, someday that stomach of yours is gonna do us in...
84. VADER’S PRIVATE CHAMBER – STAR DESTROYER
The door to the private chamber slides open, and the Dark Lord of the Sith storms into the room. His voice echoes through the chamber. VADER Jerjerrod!
JERJERROD (V.O.) It is not necessary to shout, my old friend. VADER What is the Emperor doing with my son...
JERJERROD My Lord Vader, the Emperor does not have to answer to you... besides, I don’t believe he has your son. Where did you come by this piece of erroneous information?
VADER He’s been seen at the palace...and that’s where I’m going! JERJERROD The Emperor would prefer you didn’t...you would go against his wishes. The Rebel attack is about to begin. You are truly fearless, my old friend.
Vader lifts the Grand Moff by the neck and begins to lift him off the ground with one hand; Jerjerrod gasps for air and struggles to free himself from the Dark Lord’s iron grip.
VADER You are not my friend, bureaucrat. I will go to the palace, but you will not live to see it. I no longer wish to be annoyed by your simpering ways.
JERJERROD The Emperor will destroy you for this.
Vader snaps the man’s neck, and he drops to the floor in a heap. VADER I think not...your importance has been greatly exaggerated. Vader exits the room, and the door slams shut behind him.
85. EXT. SPACE – REBEL FLEET
The vast Rebel fleet stretches out as far as the eye can see. Overhead, a dozen CORELLIAN small BATTLESHIPS fly in formation over the fleet. Fighters and battle cruisers surround the

largest of the Rebel Starships; the mammoth HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.
86: INT. WAR ROOM – HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE
Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and kinds sit on bleachers in a circle to one side of the war room. In the center of the bleacher area is a hologram model of Had Abbadon, the sanctuary moon and the Death Stars. Standing in the center is General Madine and ADMIRAL ACKBAR.
On a raised area in front of the bleachers are MON MOTHMA, the Leader of the Alliance and several senators. Mon Mothma is a stern, but beautiful woman in her fifties. Lando sits on the bleachers with the other Rebel commanders.
GENERAL MADINE The Corellian fleet has just arrived. All units are now in position and accounted for. The attack can begin!
There is a cheer from the Commanders. Admiral Ackbar, a pale blue non-human CREATURE, moves to the center of the stage. He speaks in an unusual language that is translated, by a computer, and transmitted to the commanders’ headphones.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR You have all been briefed on your targets. Green Group will attack the Death Stars...Red Group will attack Had Abbadon...Blue Group will attack the Imperial fleet, here and the planet’s surface, here and here. If the Empire is to fall, all of the objectives must be destroyed.
GENERAL MADINE There will be no second chance. The expeditionary unit on the sanctuary moon will signal when they have targeted the main shield generator. If they are unsuccessful, and the energy shield is still in place around the Death Stars when the attack begins...well...do the best you can.
A murmur runs through the assembly; which is hushed when Mon Mothma stands. She slowly looks over the Rebel commanders before she speaks.
MON MOTHMA We ask much of you. The fate of the Alliance rests in this one decisive battle. But, if the Death Stars are completed, many of our homelands will be destroyed and the Alliance will crumble...we have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. The time has come to stop hiding and face the Empire one to one...Man your ships with fortitude and resolve, for good shall triumph. May the Force be with you.
87. EXT. RAIN FOREST – MOON
Han, Chewie and the robots are still hanging in the Ewok trap. The

Star Captain and the Wookiee are attempting to saw through the top of the net with small pieces of metal. Artoo is cutting away at the bottom of the net.
HAN This is going to take forever.
Suddenly, Artoo cuts through, and the entire group tumbles out of the net, crashing to the ground. As Han regains his senses and sits up, he realizes they are surrounded by about twenty Ewoks, pointing long spears at them.
HAN Point that thing somewhere else!
Han pushes the spear out of his face, and a second Ewok lunges at him. Han manages to deflect the oncoming spear, but his arm is cut rather severely. Wicket rushes forward and pushes his fellow Ewok away, scolding him with a lot of loud screeching and yelling. Han is holding his arm in pain. Chewie growls at the Ewoks. Artoo and Threepio are tangled up in what’s left of the net.
HAN Threepio, can you understand this gibberish?
Threepio untangles himself from the net and sits up, still a little rattled.
THREEPIO Oh, my head...
When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and mumble among themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue, and one of the Ewoks nearest to the golden robot drops his spear and bows on his hands and knees. In a moment, all of the other Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han looks around at the prostrate creatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to chant at Threepio.
HAN What did you say to them?
THREEPIO Hello, I think...I could be wrong, they’re using a very primitive dialect, but I believe they think I’m some sort of deity.
Artoo and Chewbacca both laugh at this. Han shakes his head in disbelief.
HAN Well, use your divine influence to get us out of this... THREEPIO I beg your pardon, Sir, but that wouldn’t be proper.
HAN Wouldn’t be proper?!?
THREEPIO It’s against my programming.
HAN Listen, you bend the rules a little, or I’m going to bend you! Several Ewok spears are thrust in Captain Solo’s face as he grabs for Threepio.
88. HAD ABBADON – THE TOMB’S PRISON
Luke lies unconscious on a small island in the middle of a hot lava

lake. A hot wind blows across his face and wakes him. He looks around at his hostile surroundings and suddenly becomes aware of another person sitting behind him. He turns on the intruder with Jedi speed. The shrouded figure doesn’t move or even look up.
LUKE Ben...
Slowly, the hooded figure looks up, revealing his face. It is Ben Kenobi in the flesh.
BEN I could no longer stay in the netherworld.
LUKE But Yoda said...
BEN ...that I would become one with the Force and choose not to return to the material world? That your anger prevented me from... LUKE But I’m not angry...not anymore...I understand why you didn’t tell me about my father. I do.
BEN I know. And I am here to help you destroy the Emperor, and...your father.
LUKE I can’t.
Suddenly Yoda appears beside Ben.
YODA You can and you will...I in the netherworld, and Obi-Wan at your side. Help you we will.
89. EXT. SPACE – REBEL FLEET
A vast array of mighty Rebel Star Cruisers move through the heavens, surrounded by hundreds of tiny fighters of all types.
90. INT. REBEL CRUISER – BRIDGE
Captain New and Lando sit above the main control deck of the Rebel Cruiser.
CAPTAIN NEW Admiral Ackbar is bringing the third fleet into position. LANDO Are the light speed coordinates set?
CAPTAIN NEW Yes, Sir.
LANDO Have Red Group move their ships further out. We can’t afford any collisions on re-entry.
Captain New repeats into the com-link.
CAPTAIN NEW Back off, Red Group. (to Lando) How long do you think we’re going to have to wait out here?
LANDO Leia missed her scheduled check-in. So all we can do is hope it won’t be long.
91. INT. CAVE – EWOK VILLAGE
A long procession of Ewoks winds its’ way toward the village square. Han is tied to a long pole and is wrapped in vines, cocoon-like. The pole is carried on the shoulders of eight Ewoks, and are followed by Chewie and Artoo tied up in a similar fashion. Behind the captives,

Threepio is carried on a litter Emperor-style, on the shoulders of ten Ewoks.
When they reach the village square, Han, Chewie and Artoo are placed on large spits over what looks like a barbeque pit. Logray comes out of one of the huts and slowly walks to the raised area where they have set down Threepio in his litter. The medicine man stands before the golden droid, studying him very carefully. Han and Chewie begin to look a little worried as Ewoks start to put firewood in the pit below them.
HAN Threepio, they’re going to barbeque us unless you do something!
Threepio stands, and says something in the Ewok tongue. Logray gasps and falls to his hands and knees chanting a prayer. The rest of the Ewoks do the same. Threepio asks the Ewoks to stand and as they do, he walks through the crowd of funny little creatures, and stands before Han. He says something to Logray, pointing at his friends tied to the stakes. The medicine man replies in a most animated way. He appears to be a little upset by what the golden droid has told him.
HAN Well, what’d they say?
THREEPIO I’m rather embarrassed, Sir, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. He is quite offended that I should suggest otherwise...
Chewie barks angrily at Threepio.
HAN You said it, Chewie, and tell them you’ll do more than offend them if they don’t do as you say. Tell them you have the power to make this place cave in, or something.
THREEPIO Oh, I couldn’t do that Captain Solo, what if they asked me to prove it! Let me see if I can’t persuade them another way.
Threepio turns to Logray and carries on a rather long-winded conversation with the medicine man. The Ewok answers the droid and then goes over to Han, poking him in several places. He then moves over to Chewie, poking the growling Wookiee also, and finally he goes over to Artoo and taps his metal hide two or three times. Logray orders the Ewoks to untie the little astro droid, which they do, sending him crashing to the ground with a scream.
THREEPIO Careful, careful, I mean...
He continues in the Ewok tongue as the furry creatures stand Artoo upright. The little droid is angry and beeps a blue streak at Teebo, causing him to back up in fear. Artoo continues to pursue the Ewok

with angry whistles and beeps. Finally, Artoo zaps the Ewok with an electric charge and Teebo turns running into one of the huts, screaming.
THREEPIO Artoo, stop that! You’re only going to make things worse. Artoo beeps angry chatter at the taller droid.
THREEPIO I beg your pardon? I have no intention of taking orders from you!
The stubby little droid has moved under Han and starts to cut him loose. The Ewoks become upset and start for Han and Artoo. The little droid lets out a loud screech and turns on the Ewoks, still angry, and whistles at them. They scatter in all directions as the little droid chases one of them around in circles.
Threepio raises his hands and shouts at the Ewoks in their squealing language. He resembles an evangelist saving his children. The Ewoks fall to the ground, in homage to the golden droid. Threepio points to several Ewoks and barks a command. The Ewoks rush to untie Han and Chewbacca, as Artoo scolds and advises them. The two prisoners are cut loose and drop to the ground in a heap.
92. INT. CHIEF’S HUT
Wicket, Teebo, Logray and several other Ewoks enter the chief’s hut, followed by Threepio and several more Ewoks. On the far side of the hut sits Chief Chirpa and the village elders. To one side of this group stands Leia, wearing an animal skin dress. She sees Threepio and rushes over to him, but is stopped by Ewok guards.
LEIA Threepio!
THREEPIO Mistress Leia?
LEIA AND THREEPIO (together) What are you doing here??
Leia looks past the golden robot and sees Han and Chewie enter the hut, surrounded by Ewoks. Han sees her at the same time. Leia runs to the dashing Star Captain and throws her arms around him. He swings her around in an embrace. Artoo finally trundles into the hut and begins to whistle a happy tune.
LEIA Han, you escaped, you’re alive!
HAN If you call this living. Who are these friends of yours anyway? LEIA I don’t know. I haven’t had much success communicating with them. They’re friendly enough, but they won’t let me leave.
Threepio is sitting on Chief Chirpa’s throne, and all the Ewoks, including the Chief and Logray, bow down before him. The Ewok guards poke at Han, Leia and Chewie, causing them to kneel also. Han refuses to kneel.

HAN You’re crazy if you think I’m...
He is jabbed with one of the sharp spears and immediately sits down. HAN All right. All right... Threepio, you’d better tell them why we’re here, and quick... (to Leia) They think he’s the creator or something...
LEIA Maybe he can convince them how important it is for us to leave. Threepio stands and begins a long animated speech in the Ewoks’ native tongue. The Ewok elders, Chief and medicine man sit around the fire listening to Threepio speak in their squeaky language. He points several times to Han and company, then pantomimes an Imperial walker, then makes a crude sound that signifies an explosion. The Ewoks stare at Han and Leia and mumble among themselves. Logray confers with the Chief, then asks Threepio a question. The golden droid answers, and the Ewok Chief starts to shake his head in a negative fashion.
Wicket can contain himself no longer, stands up and makes a rather fiery speech. The Chief and elders nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement pointing at Wicket, then at Threepio, then finally at Han and company.
Suddenly, all the Ewoks jump up with a great yip and cheer. Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug Han, Leia and Chewie. One starts to hug Artoo, but thinks better of it as the little droid backs off with a low warning rumble. Han pulls one of the clinging Ewoks from around his neck, and sets the funny little creature on the ground, giving him a light pat on the head.
THREEPIO You are now a part of the tribe. They welcome your efforts to kill the giant walkers and they will give you what they can... HAN Great! We’ll need supplies and two of their best warriors to guide us to that ion cannon.
LEIA Let’s just hope the Empire hasn’t gotten there first.
93. INT. REBEL CRUISER – MAIN BRIDGE
A hologram of a Rebel officer appears before Lando and the cruiser captain.
HOLOGRAM OFFICER Commander, the fleet has been spotted by an Imperial Star Destroyer. We are currently in pursuit...
The hologram fades off.
CAPTAIN That finishes it; we can’t stay out here much longer.
A second hologram appears. It is the Admiral.
ADMIRAL All commands will hold their position. The Empire will need a sizable fleet to attack us, and I doubt if they will discover our target,

so we still have a bit more time. Sit tight.
LANDO If we don’t get that signal soon, I’m going to begin to think that they didn’t make it. They’re probably just trying to make us nervous.
CAPTAIN Well, they’ve succeeded.
94. EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE – FOREST
Han swings from the cave entrance to the rickety footbridge where Leia, Threepio and Artoo are waiting for Teebo. Chewie waits with Wicket in the cave entrance for his turn to swing across.
HAN Threepio, you and Artoo are going to have to make your way back to the Millenium Falcon and signal the fleet to attack...
Chewie swings across and lands with a gleeful bark.
HAN You’d better take one of these fuzzies with you and be careful. You might run into one of those patrols.
LEIA We should have signaled some time ago, so hurry.
Artoo, Threepio, and Teebo hurry off across the shaky wooden walkway.
95. EXT. LANDING AREA – HAD ABBADON
The Imperial shuttle lands on the windswept platform of Had Abbadon. TIE Fighters fly overhead as the boarding ramp lowers and Lord Vader descends to the flight deck. He walks alone toward the Imperial palace.
96. INT. MAIN HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
Vader’s footsteps echo through the vast, long hallway. The Royal Guards that line the walls watch him with great fear. Finally he reaches the massive doors that open on to the throne room. The two guards on either side of the doors move to block the Dark Lord.
1ST GUARD I’m sorry Lord Vader, the Emperor does not wish... Both of the guards are stopped in their tracks as they drop their weapons and grab for their throats in a vain attempt to breathe. They drop gasping to the floor as the giant doors slide open and the Dark Lord enters the Emperor’s chamber.
97. INT. THRONE ROOM – HAD ABBADON
Vader storms into the throne room and marches right up to where the Emperor is sitting. The Emperor slowly raises his head to stare at the Dark Lord.
VADER Where is he?
EMPEROR Safe...There is no need for you to worry. I will take good care of him...
VADER It is for me to train my son...you must...

The Emperor raises his hand, and Vader’s breathing suddenly stops. The Dark Lord struggles at his controls, attempting to regain his air supply. He chokes.
EMPEROR You forget yourself...Lord Vader. I will tolerate no more discussion on the subject. The boy is mine to train. Your place is with the fleet.
Vader collapses on the floor and the Emperor lowers his hand. Vader starts breathing again and rises to a kneeling position.
VADER Forgive me, master.
EMPEROR The Rebels will soon begin their attack. You must be ready for them. For now that I have all of them in one place, they will be crushed once and for all.
VADER Yes, my master.
EMPEROR Now take your leave, for I have your son to attend to. Vader rises and exits the throne room, and the giant door slides closed behind him.
98. EXT. REBEL FLEET – SPACE
The vast Rebel fleet drifts through space.
99. INT. REBEL CRUISER – COCKPIT
The tension mounts as the crew waits for the signal to attack. The moments tick by, and Lando raps his fingers on the console. He looks worried, and speaks into the com-link.
LANDO Admiral, I don’t think we can wait much longer out here. That Imperial destroyer should have returned with reinforcements by now. Something’s funny...I’ll bet they know what we’re after and are just waiting for us to move...
ADMIRAL (V.O.) That’s possible, but if we go in and that shield is up, we won’t stand a chance...! We’ll wait a little longer.
Lando clicks off the intercom and turns to the captain.
LANDO I have a bad feeling about this. I hope we get that signal soon.
He lapses back into his preoccupied worried look.
100. EXT. MILLENIUM FALCON – LANDING SITE
The Falcon is surrounded by a half dozen Imperial rocket bikes. Threepio, Artoo and the little Ewok Teebo are hidden in the foliage. The stubby little droid beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO Don’t ask me what to do! You think of something. I’m not designed for this sort of thing.
Teebo chatters something and Threepio barks a question, which the Ewok quickly answers. The golden droid chatters his approval, and

Teebo takes off into the underbrush.
THREEPIO He’s going to distract them so that we can sneak inside. Artoo beeps a question.
THREEPIO I don’t know, but he says it’s something that he has wanted to do for a long time. I hope it works.
All of the scouts are inside the Falcon except one, who is leaning against the hatchway sound asleep. The little Ewok darts out of the foliage on the far side of the Falcon, and hides behind one of the giant landing gears. Teebo can hear the troops moving around inside the ship.
101. INT. FALCON – HOLD
Several of the Imperial scouts lounge around as the others go through the storage compartments, throwing things on the floor of the hold.
102. INT. FALCON – COCKPIT
A scout moves about the cockpit, flipping switches and searching everywhere. Finding nothing, he exits the cockpit, just as a light starts flashing on the main control panel. A faint voice can be heard on the com-link.
VOICE Threepio? Threepio?
103. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
Han, Chewie, Wicket and Leia are hidden in the trees overlooking the ion cannon. The control bunker is swarming with Imperial troops and two scout walkers patrol the clearing in front of the gun. Chewie quietly growls at Han who is speaking into a com-link.
HAN ...come in, Threepio...blast it! You’re right Chewie, we should have given them a com-link.
LEIA I hope they’re not in trouble.
HAN Not as much as we are anyway. With any luck, they won’t be able to signal the fleet until we clean up this little mess.
LEIA How are we going to get in there?
HAN I don’t know! This whole thing was your idea, you tell me!
Leia shrugs her shoulders and lets out a great sigh.
104. EXT. MILLENIUM FALCON – LANDING SITE
Teebo crawls between several of the rocket bikes to the snoring sounds of the sleeping guard. The little Ewok struggles up onto the seat of one of the powerful rocket bikes. The scout momentarily wakes up, which stops his snoring. Teebo freezes. The scout goes back to sleep, and the little Ewok gives the control panel of the rocket bike a puzzled look. He scratches his head, chattering to himself, and

then with a shrug, he starts flipping switches.
Artoo whistles in hushed tones, as he and Threepio watch the Ewok on the bike.
THREEPIO I have no idea what he’s up to...quite frankly, I don’t think he knows what he’s doing. He’d better be careful or he’ll hurt himself. Artoo beeps a question.
THREEPIO I don’t know why I listened to him either.
Teebo pulls a little lever on the side of the bike, and the machine comes to life with a roar. The scout wakes up with a start as the little Ewok screams and shoots out of the clearing on the rocket bike, holding on for dear life. The scout shouts an alarm and, firing at Teebo, runs for his own bike. The other five scouts rush out of the Falcon to see what the commotion is all about. The scout on the bike yells at the others as he races out of the clearing after the stolen bike. 1ST SCOUT He took the bike!
The rest of the scouts jump on their bikes and take off after the Ewok, leaving the scout whose bike was stolen behind. In anger, he throws a container to the ground and wanders back inside the Falcon. Threepio and Artoo watch all of this from their hiding place. Artoo beeps a statement and starts for the Falcon. Threepio reluctantly follows.
THREEPIO I can’t believe I’m doing this. I must be malfunctioning. 105. INT. HOLD – MILLENIUM FALCON
The scout continues to rummage through cabinets in the hold of the Falcon as Artoo and Threepio slip by in the background, heading for the cockpit.
106. INT. COCKPIT – FALCON
Threepio and Artoo enter the cockpit.
THREEPIO Hurry, Artoo, before we’re discovered!
Artoo plugs into a computer socket and beeps a message. A series of tones is heard, then the stubby droid whistles a few words and exits the cockpit with Threepio following.
107. INT. HOLD – MILLENIUM FALCON
Threepio peeks around the corner to see the scout standing quite near him. He ducks back into the hallway, and whispers to Artoo. THREEPIO We’re trapped.
108. INT. REBEL CRUISER – MAIN BRIDGE
The control panel lights up as Artoo’s signal is received by the Rebel fleet. A hologram of the Admiral appears before Lando and the cruiser captain.

ADMIRAL We have just received the confirmation signal. All ships will prepare to move into light speed.
LANDO They did it! They’ve blown up the shield generator. Come on, let’s get this bucket moving!
The controller pulls back on the light speed throttle, and the stars streak and disappear out the bridge window.
109. EXT. FOREST – LANDING SITE
Teebo stumbles out of the forest and into the clearing in front of the Falcon. The little Ewok is pretty beaten up and appears to be in shock. He lets out a loud howl.
110. INT. FALCON – HOLD
The scout runs out of the hold and starts down the boarding ramp with his gun drawn. Artoo tears out after him, with Threepio following. THREEPIO Wait, Artoo, what are you doing?
The scout stands at the foot of the ramp with his gun pointed at Teebo. But before he can fire, Artoo comes flying down the ramp and plows into him, knocking the Imperial scout head over heels. The laser pistol fires harmlessly in the air. Threepio rushes past the fallen Imperial trooper and follows Artoo and Teebo into the dense underbrush.
111. INT. HAD ABBADON – HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
The huge doors to the throne room slide open and the Emperor strides into the long hallway. The Royal Guards snap to attention as he passes. About halfway down the hallway, an Imperial General rushes up to the Emperor, and bows.
GENERAL My Lord, the Rebels have moved into hyperspace. The attack is imminent.
EMPEROR. Excellent. Alert the fleet!
The general rushes off, and the Emperor continues until he arrives at a large stone room flanked by rows of elevators. He enters one of the elevators and it descends into a vast steaming pit. Out of the shadows of a large column, a large dark figure emerges...it is Darth Vader. He raises his hand and the guards turn away, allowing him to sneak into one of the elevators and follow the Emperor.
112. INT. HAD ABBADON – TOMB’S DUNGEON
Luke stands with a start and begins to look around. Ben slowly stands also.
LUKE Did you feel that?
BEN Yes. It’s the Emperor. He’s moving this way...
LUKE ...and so is my father.

BEN He is following the Emperor. Yoda!
YODA’S VOICE I am between them and the Force...cloud their minds, I will.
BEN Luke, you must take them on one at a time. Together, they will destroy you...
The Emperor enters the cavern and looks across to the boiling lava lake. He sees Ben and is surprised.
EMPEROR So you are not dead after all, Obi-Wan. I thought I felt your presence in the netherworld. So, you have returned. But you have failed...the boy is mine, and will soon embrace the Dark Side. YODA It is you who have failed, my old friend.
The Emperor turns around to see the shimmering image of Yoda standing before him.
EMPEROR You!
YODA Evil one, this will be the last day of your existence. EMPEROR Your presence in the netherworld can do me no harm. And neither can this boy or this old man.
YODA Your fear is strong...overestimate your abilities, you do. Vader steps out of the shadows and stands next to the Emperor. VADER My Master, they must be destroyed. Now it is too late to turn the boy.
Luke looks at his father, then reaches out and Vader’s lasersword leaps off the Dark Lord’s belt and into the young Jedi’s hand. Luke ignites the lasersword as the Emperor pulls a sword out of his sleeve and tosses it to Vader.
EMPEROR Destroy them.
Vader’s sword ignites and he starts to move toward his son. Luke backs away.
113. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
Wicket chatters and pulls on Han Solo’s arm, trying to get him to move away.
HAN Don’t bother me. Go away.
LEIA I think he’s trying to tell you something.
Wicket points to the top of a tall tree, then makes a diving motion down to the walker.
HAN You mean jump?!?
Han makes a motion with his hand and the little Ewok shakes his head yes.
Han looks up at the tree, then down at the walker.
HAN It’s too far, forget it.

A small com-link on Leia’s belt begins to buzz. LEIA The fleet! They’re attacking!
HAN That doesn’t give us much time. Come on... 114. EXT. SPACE – REBEL FLEET
The massive Rebel fleet moves toward the distant planet of Had Abbadon.
115. INT. REBEL CRUISER – BRIDGE
Lando moves over to one of the computer screens, then turns back to the Cruiser Captain.
LANDO Have group seven and nine split off and start phase two... CAPTAIN Several Imperial cruisers are approaching!
LANDO Launch the fighters!
116. EXT. SPACE – REBEL CRUISER
A group of X-Wing Fighters are dropped out of the main hold, and rocket off toward the approaching Imperial Cruisers. Behind the Imperial warships, the two Death Stars orbit Had Abbadon. The Rebel fighters attack the Imperial Cruisers and the fighting is intense. 117. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
Artoo, Threepio and Teebo make their way onto a ridge overlooking the gun emplacement. Artoo beeps and whistles as he spots Han and Leia.
THREEPIO I see them! Come on, they need help!
He turns to Teebo and explains this to him. He repeats the Ewok word for help, then grabs a shell horn at his side and blows. A loud howl echoes throughout the forest. All of the Stormtroopers below look up. So does Han, Leia and Wicket. Wicket starts to chatter excitedly and points to the droids.
HAN Now what?
LEIA It’s Artoo and Threepio.
HAN Did they have to announce their arrival? Look out!
Laser blasts start to explode all around them as the Stormtroopers discover their presence. They attempt to return the fire, but are quickly surrounded. Chewie barks his anger as the troops take away their weapons.
HAN Wait till I get my hands on those droids!
118. EXT. SPACE – BATTLE
A fierce battle rages as the Rebel cruisers attempt to move past the Imperial ships and strike at the Death Stars. One of the Rebel ships makes it through and starts its attack on one of the uncompleted battle stations, but the laser bolts fail to reach their target.

119. INT. REBEL CRUISER
Lando moves forward to the main viewing port as the surface of the giant Death Star races by. He turns to the cruiser Captain.
LANDO The deflector shield is still up. They haven’t knocked out the shield generator.
CAPTAIN Even if more of our ships break through, they won’t be able to damage the Death Stars.
A huge blast rocks the ship.
CONTROLLER Two Star Destroyers are coming in!
LANDO There won’t be anything left of us if those shield generators aren’t destroyed real quick.
120. INT. HAD ABBADON – TOMB’S DUNGEON
Vader brings his lasersword down hard on his son, but Luke is able to block his father’s blow. A quick sword exchange, and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange, and the Dark Lord recovers, pushing the young Jedi onto a small rock surrounded by the bubbling pool of lava. Ben and the Emperor watch from the far side of the cavern. EMPEROR He is every inch his father.
BEN He is stronger than you imagine, and has many allies. EMPEROR Allies? If they are all as you, I have no concern. Once the boy has killed his father, I will have him destroy you...
BEN Perhaps, but it will not save you. I have foreseen your death at the hands of Skywalker.
EMPEROR But I have not, therefore it cannot be.
BEN Unless you can no longer see...
Luke fights back with all of his strength and drives his father back across the tiny rocks. A crashing blow by Luke causes Vader to lose his balance and fall onto one of the small rock islands, his sword hand landing in the molten lava. His sword and part of his metal are melting away. Vader backs away from his son, expecting the death blow at any moment. But Luke hesitates as Ben and the Emperor watch.
EMPEROR Finish it, boy! It is the power of the Dark Side that you feel...
Luke lowers his lasersword.
LUKE I cannot. I will not turn to the Dark Side. I only fight in self- defense, not to do your Emperor’s bidding.
With that, Luke extinguishes the lasersword and tosses it to Ben. LUKE If he is to be destroyed, you must do it.
121. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT

Han, Chewie, Wicket and Leia are led to an area in front of the control bunker. Several Stormtroopers rush up the ridge to where Artoo and Threepio were last seen. They look around for traces of where they might have gone. A familiar whistle is heard coming from behind a large tree. The Stormtroopers move over to investigate. They surround the two droids.
THREEPIO Hello.
Suddenly, out of the trees swing a horde of Ewoks, yelling and screaming as they land on the troops from behind, stabbing them with their spears. Several of the Ewoks heave a huge boulder from high in the trees; which lands with a loud thud on the walker’s head, and bounces to the ground. A second and third boulder is heaved, one of which hits the hatch, springing it open. A half dozen Ewoks jump onto the giant war machine and pry open the hatch, fearlessly jumping into the machine with their spears ready.
In the confusion, Han and company break away from their captors and join in the battle. The Ewoks cut down trees that fall on the walkers, and sends piles of logs toward the huge machines; which causes them to slip and fall. Han climbs a tree and swings down on one of the walkers. He blasts open the hatch and subdues the walker pilot. Chewie and Wicket swing onto another walker.
Leia, Chief Chirpa and the other Ewoks charge the entrance to the control bunker, but the alert Imperial troops manage to close the blast door shutting out the Ewoks, as well as many of the Imperial scouts. The Rebels become pinned down in front of the door.
LEIA We’ve got to get in there fast! They’ll be calling in reinforcements!
Chief Chirpa chatters away, not understanding what the Princess is saying.
122. INT. WALKER – COCKPIT
Han works the controls of the giant walker, and it begins to move forward chasing the Imperial troops into the safety of the forest. Han fires a large bolt at the retreating troops. A voice comes over the com-link.
LEIA Bring the walker over by the door, we need some help!
HAN Hang on, I’m on my way!
123. INT. SECOND WALKER – COCKPIT
Chewie operates the controls of another walker as Wicket imitates him on another control panel. The little Ewok flips a switch and the cockpit lurches to one side. Chewie lets out a growl and bats the little

creature’s hands. Wicket lets out a squeal and jumps away from the control panel. Out the cockpit window, Imperial troops fire at the walker as it advances on them.
124. EXT. SPACE – DEATH STARS – REBEL STARSHIP
Rebel cruisers dive on the Death Stars, blasting away with all of the firepower available. A huge Imperial Star Destroyer moves into the conflict and blasts one of the Rebel cruisers away. It then moves to blast a second Rebel cruiser, and then another.
125. INT. REBEL CRUISER – BRIDGE
The bridge is rocked by laser blasts. Lando watches the battle out the main viewing port as the Captain approaches him.
CAPTAIN Several Star Destroyers have moved in from the planetside. Our cruisers are no match for theirs!
Lando bangs his fist on the control panel in frustration.
LANDO We’re too easy a target out here. There’s just no way to us to get through that defense shield. Tell the Admiral that we’re going to let them chase us out of the target area.
CAPTAIN If we can draw them to the far side of the planet, we can easily outrace them back to the target.
LANDO If they don’t blast that shield generator pretty quick, we’re not going to have enough of a strike group for it to make any difference. I’d give anything to know what is going on down there with that gun! 126. CLEARING – GUN EMPLACEMENT
Random laser fire from the dense foliage keeps the small band of Rebels pinned near the bunker entrance. Han and Chewie have backed the walkers up to the heavy metal door, and the Rebels have attached a long cable from the walker to a magnet on the door. Leia speaks into her comlink.
LEIA We’re all set. Let them go.
At that moment, out of the foliage come several more two-legged walkers, and about a dozen of the scout speeder bikes. They attack the Rebels at the bunker entrance and in the captured walker. Han and Chewie struggle to pull the bunker door.
Chewie and Wicket are having problems of their own. Two rocket bikes circle the walker so close their own walker can’t fire on them. The scouts blast away at the metal legs of the walker until one of the joints collapses and the walker with the Wookiee and the Ewok goes crashing to the ground. The two Rebels are shaken, but unhurt, and manage to climb out of the burning machine.
Han maneuvers the walker back to the bunker door and Chewie

helps to reestablish the cable. The walker jerks forward in one last attempt to yank the great metal door open. A loud ripping metallic screech is heard and the entire back half of the walker falls off. Han looks out of the gaping hole of his walker a little embarrassed. Leia shakes her head. The fighting ends and the last of the Imperial scouts flees into the forest.
Han takes a piece of the damaged walker and throws it down in frustration, then gets an idea. He yells down to Leia and the remaining Rebels.
HAN Get out of sight! Quick!
He goes over to the control panel and fiddles with the computer readout. He begins to speak into the walker’s com-link using several different voices, while getting information from the computer.
HAN Ah...six twenty-one bring up your reinforcements. (another voice) This is six twenty-one, we’re moving up now...
127. INT. CONTROL BUNKER – ION CANNON
About a half-dozen Imperial scouts crows around the control panel, listening to the com-link.
HAN (V.O.) Ahh...Commander Bough, move in with your
scouts. (another voice) Yes sir, we’ve got them on the run now...Look at them go!
A scout officer in the bunker smiles as the men cheer.
SCOUT OFFICER They’ve got ‘em...I wish we could see out there... HAN (V.O.) Good work. Contact Admiral....ah...Veers and tell him the Rebel resistance is broken. The gun here is secure. (another voice) Sir, could you have the scouts in the bunker come out here and give us a hand cleaning up?
SCOUT OFFICER We’re on our way out now!
128. EXT. BUNKER ENTRANCE – FOREST CLEARING
The Imperial scouts rush to the opening bunker door and exit into the glare of the sun. The scouts stop just outside the door. Puzzled, they look around and see all the destruction, but no other Imperial troops. They look up to see Han stick his head out of the damaged walker. HAN Hi there.
Before the scouts can reach for their guns, they realize they are surrounded by Ewoks. Leia rushes into the bunker. The Ewoks proceed to tie up the Imperial troops as Han climbs down from the walker. Artoo and Threepio make their way into the clearing.
129. INT. CONTROL BUNKER
Han and Leia rush about, getting the ion cannon ready to fire. They

watch the computer readout.
HAN It’s going to take a few moments to get the power up.
LEIA I just hope the fleet is still up there when it does.
130. INT. CRUISER – BRIDGE
There are only a few Rebel ships left, and they are racing for their lives trying to reach the Death Stars before the Imperial Star Destroyers. Lando plots their program on the computer display. The Captain is with him.
LANDO Captain, focus everything on the power core. When we reach target range, let go with everything.
CAPTAIN What if the shields are still up? All the firepower in the fleet couldn’t penetrate it.
LANDO We’re only going to get one more shot at it. If the shields are still up, we’ve lost.
131. INT. HAD ABBADON – TOMB’S DUNGEON
Lord Vader struggles to stand as Ben prods the Emperor onto the same small island. Luke stands behind Ben and watches.
EMPEROR You have become old and weak, Lord Vader. I will take care of this.
The Emperor turns his back on Vader and faces the old Jedi, raising his hands in the air, which causes lightning to strike at Ben.
LUKE BEN, NO!
Luke leaps in front of his mentor, and raises his hand in defense. The bolts are deflected by an invisible shield. Wherever a bolt hits, the image of Yoda momentarily appears at the point of impact. EMPEROR Your Master in the netherworld cannot protect you for long. You will turn to me or die.
The lightning bolts become more intense, and Ben is knocked unconscious. Luke drops to his knees under the pressure. EMPEROR This is the power of the Dark Side that you deny. Your strength will never match it.
Luke struggles to remain conscious against the superior power of the Emperor.
LUKE Yoda...
EMPEROR Obi-Wan foresaw my destruction at your hands, young Skywalker, but it seems his vision was clouded...Perhaps there is still another Skywalker. Why can I not see, could the netherworld have influenced my perception? Another Skywalker...your father!
The Emperor turns around to see Lord Vader flying at him. The lightning bolts around Luke disappear as Vader hits the Emperor,

knocking them both into the fiery lake of lava. The hideous screams of the Emperor are soon muted. Luke struggles to his feet and stares at the spot where his enemy and his father disappeared into the cauldron of molten rock.
Ben puts his hand on the young Jedi’s shoulder.
BEN It is in Yoda’s hands now.
["In the rough draft...Ben explains that...if Vader becomes one with the dark side of the Force, he will lose all identity. If he turns to the good side, he will pass through the Netherworld and" in the revised rough draft, Yoda "will rescue him before he becomes one with the Force." -L. Bouzerau, explanation from Star Wars The Annotated Screenplays page 300.]
LUKE He turned back to the good side.
BEN Yes, he did.
132. INT. CONTROL BUNKER
The main computer readout in the ion cannon control bunker shows the target entering the cross hairs.
HAN Target ready. Stand by, ion control.
LEIA Fire.
The ion cannon fires a series of powerful laser bolts at the main shield generator. It explodes across the surface of Had Abbadon. 133. EXT. SPACE – REBEL CRUISERS – DEATH STARS
The Rebel cruisers descend on the half-constructed Death Star, firing proton torpedoes into the center of the super-structure. There is a series of explosions, culminating in a huge explosion that engulfs the Death Star. In the distance, the second Death Star explodes in a great ball of flame.
134. INT. BRIDGE – REBEL CRUISER
A great cheer goes up among the Rebels. Lando and the Cruiser Captain congratulate each other.
135. INT. ION CANNON CONTROL BUNKER
Han lifts Leia off her feet and swings her around, laughing. Chewie lifts Wicket high over his head. Teebo hugs Threepio, who pats him on the head. The little Ewok then rushes over and hugs Artoo.
136. INT. HAD ABBADON – HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
The hallway is deserted as Luke and Ben wander, sadly thinking about what happened. The rumble of distant explosions is heard. BEN It is over...
137. EXT. EWOK FOREST VILLAGE – NIGHT
Ewoks and Rebels are singing, shouting and dancing around a huge

bonfire. The joyous sounds of native drums and musical instruments echoes through the forest.
Leia and Luke walk down a forest path some distance from the festivities. Following them are Han, Chewie and Lando and behind them are Artoo and Threepio. Luke and Leia are talking quietly. Han shakes his head in amazement as he watches the two.
HAN Her brother! I just can’t believe it.
They stop at the edge of the clearing where the celebration is taking place. Leia gives her newfound brother a great big hug. They are quickly surrounded by Ewoks and friends. Leia turns and gives Han a big hug and passionate kiss. Everyone cheers and yells as they all move closer to the bonfire. Sadly, Luke wanders back into the forest alone. Leia starts to go after him, but is stopped by Han.
HAN He needs to be alone.
They turn back to the celebration.
[NEXT-TO-LAST PAGE MISSING - DETAILS IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH]
["In the revised rough draft (Scene 138, Luke talks to Ben, and then)...Yoda suddenly appears as flesh and blood. His stay in the Netherworld has been resolved since Vader has turned to the good side. Yoda also has been able to prevent Vader from becoming one with the Force. Luke's father appears, and they all join the celebration, except for Yoda, who watches them all from the side..." - L. Bouzerau, explanation from Star Wars The Annotated Screenplays page 320.]
139. CONTINUED
Threepio is carried on the shoulders of eight Ewoks in a litter. He is a little confused and dismayed at all the attention he is getting. The furry little Ewoks set the golden droid down a raised platform and bow before him as the dancing continues. Several young female Ewoks place a garland of flowers around Threepio’s head, and he waves at the crowd.
Quietly watching the festivities from the side is Yoda, the Jedi Master. He scans the crowd picking out Artoo, Threepio, Lando and Chewie, Han and Leia, and finally Ben, Luke and his father. He lets out a great sigh.

Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to and from the small planet of Naboo.
While the Congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace, to settle the conflict...
PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads toward the beautiful green planet of Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships. 2. INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER – COCKPIT
In the cockpit of the cruiser, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one of the battleships.
QUI-GON (off screen voice) Captain.
The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.
CAPTAIN Yes, sir?
QUI-GON (V.O.) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN Yes, sir.
The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, an odd-looking Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply.
CAPTAIN With respect for the Trade Federation, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE Yes, yes, of coarse... ahhh... as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we’d be happy to receive the Ambassador... Happy to.
2. CONTINUED
The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms ever closer. 3. EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – DOCKING BAY – SPACE (FX)
The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation battleship.
4. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – DOCKING BAY – SPACE
A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-3, waits at the door to the docking bay.

Two WORKER DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9, stand in the foreground. PK-4 Whoever it is must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them.
The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay. Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-3. They move off down the hallway.
EG-9 A Republic cruiser! That’s trouble... don’t you think?
PR-4 I’m not made to think. 5. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – CONFERENCE ROOM
A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the formal conference room by TC-3.
TC-3 I hope you honored sirs with the most comfortable here. My master will be with you shortly.
The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI-GON JINN. He backs out the door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has very long white hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.
OBI-WAN I have a bad feeling about this.
QUI-GON I don’t feel anything.
5. CONTINUED
OBI-WAN It’s not about the mission, Master, it’s something... elsewhere... elusive.
QUI-GON Don’t center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here where it belongs.
OBI-WAN Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future... QUI-GON ... but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN Yes, Master... How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor’s demands?
QUI-GON These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.
6. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC- 3.
NUTE (shaken) What?!? What did you say?
TC-3 The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
DOFINE I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,

we’re done for!
NUTE Stay calm! I’ll wager the Senate isn’t aware of the Supreme Chancellor’s moves here. Go. Distract them until I can contact Lord Sidious.
DOFINE Are you brain dead? I’m not going in there with two Jedi! Send the droid.
DOFINE turns to TC-3, who lets out a squeaky sigh.
7. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – CONFERENCE ROOM QUI-GON and OBI-WAN sit at the large conference table. OBI-WAN Is it their nature to make us wait this long?
QUI-GON is thinking. The door to the conference room slides open, and TC-3 enters with a tray of drinks and food. OBI-WAN takes a drink.
QUI-GON No... I sense an unusual amount of fear here for something as trivial as a trade dispute.
8. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
NUTE, DOFINE and RUNE HAAKO are before the hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS, a robed figure whose face is obscured by a hood. DOFINE ... This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished! We dare not go against those Jedi.
DARTH SIDIOUS You seem more worried about the Jedi than you are about me, Dofine. I am amused... Viceroy!
NUTE, looking very nervous, steps forward.
NUTE Yes, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS I don’t want that stunted slime in my sight again... do you understand?
NUTE Yes, My Lord.
NUTE gives DOFINE a fierce look, and DOFINE, terrified, rushes off the bridge.
DARTH SIDIOUS This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans, Viceroy. Begin landing your troops.
NUTE Ahhh, My Lord, is that... legal?
DARTH SIDIOUS I will make it legal.
8. CONTINUED
NUTE And the... Jedi?
DARTH SIDIOUS The Chancellor should never have brought them into this. Kill them, immediately.
NUTE Ye... Yes, My Lord. As you wish. 9. INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER – COCKPIT – DOCKING BAY
In the cockpit of the cruiser, the CAPTAIN and the PILOT look up and

see a gun turret swing around and point directly at them. PILOT Captain!? Look!!
CAPTAIN No! Warn...
10. EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – HANGAR BAY – SPACE (FX)
The battleship gun fires. The republic cruiser EXPLODES.
11. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – CONFERENCE ROOM
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN leap to a standing position with their laser swords drawn. TC-3 jumps back, startled, spilling the drinks on his tray.
TC-3 Ahhh... Sorry, sir. The Viceroy...
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn off their swords and listen intently. A faint hissing sound can be heard.
QUI-GON Gas!
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN each take a sudden deep breath and hold it. The exotic bird-like creatures in the cage drop dead. 12. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – HALLWAY
A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference room hallway.
NUTE They must be dead by now. Blast what’s left of them.
The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-3, carrying the tray of drinks.
12 CONTINUED
TC-3 Oh, excuse me, so sorry.
The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they can fire. 13. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
The bridge is a cacophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO- 1 on the viewscreen.
OWO-1 ... Not sure exactly what...
OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried look.
NUTE What in blazes is going on down there?
RUNE Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
NUTE Well, not exactly, but I don’t... (panicked) Seal off the bridge... RUNE That won’t be enough, sir.
The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

NUTE I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE We will not survive this. 14. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – HALLWAY – OUTSIDE BRIDGE
QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS crashing into the wall. QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it. 15. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.
NUTE Close the blast doors!!
15. CONTINUED
The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door.
RUNE ...They’re still coming through!
On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.
NUTE Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE Where are those destroyer droids?! 16. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – HALLWAY – OUTSIDE BRIDGE
Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle configuration. QUI-GON can’t see them but senses their presence.
QUI-GON Destroyer droids!
OBI-WAN Offhand, I’d say this mission is past the negotiation stage. QUI-GON I know, I know.
The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways, blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be seen.
P-59 Switch to bio... There they are!
The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut. 17. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL DROIDS’ POV speeds to the doorway.
RUNE We have them on the run, sir... they’re no match for destroyer droids.

TEY HOW Sir, a transmission from the planet.
17. CONTINUED
RUNE It’s Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE At last we’re getting results.
On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS.
NUTE Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is pleased.
AMIDALA You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy... Your trade boycott has ended.
NUTE smirks at RUNE.
NUTE I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours.
NUTE I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bothered to vote.
AMIDALA Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I’m aware the Chancellor’s Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have been commanded to reach a settlement.
NUTE I know nothing about any Ambassadors... you must be mistaken.
AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.
AMIDALA Beware, Viceroy... the Federation is going too far this time. NUTE Your Majesty, we would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much. Good day.
The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.
RUNE She’s right, the Senate will never...
17. CONTINUED (2) NUTE It’s too late now.
RUNE Do you think she suspects an attack?
NUTE I don’t know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there. 18. INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM
The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.
PALPATINE ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor... his Ambassadors did arrive. It must be the... get... negotiate...
The hologram of PALPATINE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA Senator Palpatine, we’re losing you. (turns to Panaka) What’s happening?
CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SERGEANT
CAPT. PANAKA Check the transmission generators... BIBBLE A malfunction?
CAPT. PANAKA It could be the Federation jamming us, Your Highness.
BIBBLE A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion!
AMIDALA Don’t jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not dare to invade.
CAPT. PANAKA The Senate would revoke their trade permits, and they would be finished for good.
AMIDALA We must continue to rely on negotiation.
18. CONTINUED
BIBBLE Negotiation? We’ve lost all communications!... and where are the Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend ourselves.
CAPT. PANAKA This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war. 19. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – MAIN BAY
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing craft.
QUI-GON Battle droids.
OBI-WAN An invasion army.
QUI-GON It’s an odd play for the Trade Federation. We’ve got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum.
OBI-WAN You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short. 20. EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT – TWILIGHT (FX) Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo. 21. EXT. NABOO SWAMP – SHALLOW LAKE – TWILIGHT Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN’s head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist. OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then disappears again

under the muddy swamp. Troop Transports (MTT’s) emerge from the landing craft.
22. EXT. NABOO SWAMP – TWILIGHT
QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR’s great tongue snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the wind toward him. One of the huge MTT’s bears down on the JEDI like a charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam shell in one hand.
JAR JAR Oh, noooooooooo!
JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is caught by surprise.
JAR JAR Hey, hep me! Hep me!!
QUI-GON Let go!
The machine is about to crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him. Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the war machine disappear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.
JAR JAR Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!
The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.
QUI-GON Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR I spake.
QUI-GON The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta here!
QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.
JAR JAR No... .no! Mesa stay... Mesa yous humble servaunt.
22. CONTINUED
QUI-GON That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live deb-ett, tis. Mesa culled Jaja Binkss.
In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON I have no time for this now... JAR JAR Say what?
The two STAPS barrel down on OBI-WAN. JAR JAR Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna... QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud. QUI-GON Stay down!
His head pops up.
JAR JAR: ...dieeee!
The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to catch his breath. OBI-WAN Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.
OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR JAR pulls himself out of the mud.
QUI-GON You forgot to turn your power off again, didn’t you? OBI-WAN nods sheepishly.
QUI-GON It won’t take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I hope you’ve learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN Yes, Master.
22. CONTINUED (2)
JAR JAR Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN What’s this?
QUI-GON A local. Let’s go, before more of those droids show up. JAR JAR Mure? Mure did you spake??!?
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.
JAR JAR Ex-squeeze-me, but da moto grande safe place would be Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up... Tis safe city.
They all stop.
QUI-GON A city! (Jar Jar nods his head) Can you take us there?
JAR JAR Ahhh, will... on second taut... no, not willy.
QUI-GON No??!
JAR JAR Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my’ve bean banished. My forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my goen back dare.
A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.
QUI-GON You hear that?
JAR JAR shakes his head yes.
QUI-GON That’s the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way...
OBI-WAN When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little

pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
22. CONTINUED
JAR JAR Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!
JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp. 23. EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/GRASS PLAINS – SUNRISE (FX)
The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain. OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.
RUNE ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotten onto one of your landing craft.
OOM-9 If they are down here, sir, we’ll find them. We are moving out of the swamp and are marching on the city of Oxon. There is no resistance.
NUTE Excellent. 24. EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE – TWILIGHT QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.
QUI-GON Much farther?
JAR JAR Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that turn into breathing masks.
JAR JAR My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don’t expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN Don’t worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes. JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him. 25. EXT. NABOO LAKE – UNDERWATER
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON follow. 26. INT. OTOH GUNGA – CITY SQUARE
Four GUARDS armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS,

point their lethal poles at the dripping trio.
JAR JAR Heyo-dalee, Cap’n Tarpals, Mesa back!
CAPT. TARPALS Noah gain, Jar jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big dudu this time.
CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.
JAR JAR How wude. 27. INT. OTOH GUNGA – HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM
The Bosses’ Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge’s bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI- WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.
BOSS NASS ...Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of Mackineeks up dare tis new weesong!
QUI-GON That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
BOSS NASS Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big. OBI-WAN After those droids take control of the surface, they will come here and take control of you.
27. CONTINUED
BOSS NASS No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of usen.
OBI-WAN You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of you will affect the other. You must understand this. BOSS NASS Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no care-n about da Naboo. Wesa only care-n about usen.
QUI-GON (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS Wesa gonna speed yousaway.
QUI-GON We need a transport.
BOSS NASS Wesa give yousa una bongo. Now go. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen through da core.
QUI-GON Thank you for your help. We go in peace.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.
OBI-WAN Master, what’s a bongo?
QUI-GON A transport, I hope.
The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict. QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR Ahhh... any hep hair would be hot.
JAR JAR’s soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.
27. CONTINUED (2)
OBI-WAN We don’t have time, Master.
QUI-GON Time spent here may help us. Jar Jar here may be of use to us...
OBI-WAN I sense a loss of focus.
QUI-GON Be mindful, my young Padawan! Your sensitivity to the living Force is not your strength!
OBI-WAN is embarrassed. QUI-GON walks back to BOSS NASS. QUI-GON What is to become of Jar jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be too severe.
BOSS NASS Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR (grimacing) Oooooh... Ouch!
OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.
QUI-GON We need a navigator to get us through the planet’s core. I have saved Jar Jar Binks’ life. He owes me what you call a “life debt.” BOSS NASS Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?
JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand. QUI-GON Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him.
JAR JAR Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da core... Yee guds, whata mesa sayin?!
EXT. NABOO CITY – UNDERWATER – SUB (FX)
A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving the glow of the settlement in the distance.
INT. SUB COCKPIT – UNDERWATER
OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.
JAR JAR Dis is nusen.
OBI-WAN Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along with us?... Here, take over.
JAR JAR Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??
QUI-GON You’re the navigator.
JAR JAR Yo dreamen mesa hopen...

QUI-GON Just relax, the Force will guide us...
JAR JAR Ooooh, maxibig... “da Force”... Wellen, dat smells stinkowiff.
JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral vistas are grand, fantastic, and wondrous.
OBI-WAN Why were you banished, Jar jar?
JAR JAR Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe mesa... ooooh... aaaa... clumsy.
OBI-WAN They banished you because you’re clumsy?
As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to follow.
JAR JAR Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes... yud-say boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber... den banished.
Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side. QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, luminous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked them with its long gooey tongue.
QUI-GON Full speed ahead.
Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The sub flies into the mouth of the creature.
JAR JAR Oooops.
OBI-WAN Give me the controls.
OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases the sub from its mouth.
JAR JAR Wesa free!
As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom.
QUI-GON There’s always a bigger fish.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS. NUTE The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to accept your control of the system.
NUTE The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her. DARTH SIDIOUS Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy. NUTE Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.
RUNE You didn’t tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.
INT. SUB COCKPIT – UNDERWATER
Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the power drive drops.
OBI-WAN ... we’re losing power.
OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics. QUI-GON Stay calm. We’re not in trouble yet.
JAR JAR What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak’n in here, all’n sink’n, and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN Power’s back.
The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of them.
JAR JAR Monstairs back!
The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around and speeds away.
JAR JAR (cont’d) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON Relax.
QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR’s shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.
OBI-WAN You overdid it.
The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER. OBI-WAN (cont’d) This is not good!
JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!
JAR JAR’s eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn’t so lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips away.
QUI-GON Head for that outcropping.
EXT. THEED – MAIN ROAD INTO THEED – DAY (FX)
The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to Theed, the Naboo capital.
EXT. THEED PLAZA – DAY (FX)
As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit

the transport.
NUTE Ah, victory!
INT. NABOO LAKE – UNDERWATER – SUB (FX)
The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is brightly lit.
JAR JAR Wesa dude it!
EXT. THEED – ESTUARY – DAY
Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface. The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies. QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.
JAR JAR Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON Get this thing started.
JAR JAR Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN What is it?
JAR JAR looks back to where they’re drifting. He sees they are headed for a huge waterfall.
JAR JAR What!!?? Oie boie!
OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.
JAR JAR (cont’d) Iyiiyi, wesa die’n here, hey!
QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the waterfall.
QUI-GON Come on...
OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON starts in after him.
QUI-GON (cont’d) Come on, Jar jar.
JAR JAR No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN Get up here!
JAR JAR No a mighty no!
JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.
JAR JAR (cont’d) Oie boie... mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to pull QUI-GON out of the water.
OBI-WAN That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3: (O.S) Drop your weapons!
The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them. JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI. BATTLE DROID 3B3 I said drop your weapons
QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks lose, crashing down the waterfall. The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.
JAR JAR Whoa!!!
EXT. THEED – PALACE – DAY
The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.
INT. THEED – PALACE THRONE ROOM – DAY
QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE, PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the middle of the room.
BIBBLE ... how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I’ve been assured it will be ratified by the Senate.
AMIDALA I will not co-operate.
NUTE Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps
forward) Process them.
OOM-9 Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four.
The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.
EXT. PALACE – PLAZA – DAY
QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO BIBBLE, and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN.
FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS

move forward and are also cut down by the JEDIS’ flashing lightsabres until there is only the DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.
JAR JAR Yousa guys bombad!
QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this. They move between two buildings.
QUI-GON Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor.
BIBBLE Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador. QUI-GON The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make contact with the republic.
CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.
CAPT. PANAKA They’ve knocked out all our communications. QUI-GON Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA In the main hanger. This way.
THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded INT. CENTRAL HANGER – HALLWAY – DAY
CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.
CAPT. PANAKA There are too many of them.
QUI-GON That won’t be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us. AMIDALA Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE They wouldn’t dare.
CAPT. PANAKA They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can’t afford to kill her.
QUI-GON The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation’s move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you. BIBBLE Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help. CAPT. PANAKA Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness. Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can... They will

have to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you must leave...
The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.
AMIDALA Either choice presents a great risk... to all of us... PADME We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now. AMIDALA Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be careful, Governor.
INT. CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE), followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.
CAPT. PANAKA We need to free those pilots.
CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.
OBI-WAN I’ll take care of that.
OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots.
QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.
GUARD DROID Where are you going?
QUI-GON I’m Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I’m taking those people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD You’re under arrest!
The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire, they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLE. After everyone has made it onto the ship, QUI-GON jumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger and fire as the ship takes off.
EXT. THEED – HANGER ENTRY – DAY (FX)
The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at them.
EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the deadly Federation blockade.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI- GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.
RIC OLIE ... our communications are still jammed.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – DROID HOLD
JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN. OBI-WAN Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.
OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for their paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.
JAR JAR Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip... hey? JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit. He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.
JAR JAR (Cont’d) Tis opens?... Oooops!
Many springs and things come flying out. JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.
JAR JAR (Cont’d) Yoi! Just yoken!
EXT. SPACE BATTLE (FX)
The Naboo spacecraft, surrounded by EXPLOSIONS, heads even closer to the massive Federation battleships.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAT – COCKPIT
RIC OLIE There’s the blockade, hang on.
ALARM SOUNDS fill the cockpit as OBI-WAN enters.
RIC OLIE (Cont’d) The shield generator’s been hit. Our deflector shields can’t withstand this. Power down... Hopefully the repair droids can fix it.
INT. NABOO SPACECRACT – DROID HOLD (FX)
The lights go on, and all the DROIDS are activated. DROIDS rush to an exterior air lock, except for the red one, who runs into a wall. JAR JAR holds on for dear life. One LITTLE BLUE ASTRO DROID, who is especially dedicated, lets out a loud screech as he passes JAR JAR, causing the Gungan to jump. The LITTLE DROID enters an air lock and is ejected onto the exterior of the ship.
CAPT. PANAKA Stay on course!
QUI-GON Do you have a cloaking device?
CAPT. PANAKA No, this is not a warship... we have no
weapons. We’re a non-violent people... that is why the Federation

was brave enough to attack us.
RIC OLIE We won’t make it. The shields are gone.
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – SPACE (FX)
The DROIDS pop onto the exterior of the Naboo spacecraft; the ship races across the surface of the massive Federation battleship, as its guns blast TWO ASTRO DROIDS.
OBI-WAN We’re losing droids fast.
CAPT. PANAKA If they can’t get those shield generators fixed, we will be sitting ducks.
RIC OLIE The shields are gone.
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – ENGINES – SPACE (FX)
The Federation battleship blows away ONE MORE ASTRO DROID. The BLUE DROID connects some wires, causing sparks to fly.
RIC OLIE Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.
The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.
RIC OLIE There’s not enough power to get us to Coruscant... the hyperdrive is leaking.
QUI-GON We’ll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship. QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.
OBI-WAN Here, Master. Tatooine... It’s small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA How can you be sure?
QUI-GON It’s controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT. PANAKA The Hutts??
OBI-WAN It’s risky... but there’s no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA You can’t take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters... If they discovered her...
QUI-GON ... It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation... except the Hutts aren’t looking for her, which gives us an advantage.
CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.
EXT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)
The Naboo spacecraft races away.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – CONFERENCE ROOM
NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS Destroy all high-ranking officials, Viceroy... slowly... quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty? NUTE She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
NUTE My Lord, it’s impossible to locate the ship. It’s out of our range. DARTH SIDIOUS ... not for a Sith...
A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.
DARTH SIDIOUS (Cont’d) ... Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He will find your lost ship.
NUTE Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
NUTE (Cont’d) This is getting out of hand... now there are two of them.
RUNE We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – QUEENS CHAMBERS
QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.
CAPT. PANAKA ... An extremely well put together little droid. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
AMIDALA It is to be commended... what is its number?
The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps. CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:
CAPT. PANAKA R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal... Padme!
PADME bows before the QUEEN.
AMIDALA (Cont’d) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our gratitude... (to Panaka) Continue, Captain.
CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON. QUI-GON Your Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It’s controlled by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with

the Jedi on this.
QUI-GON You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.
AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN AREA
PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astro Droid. JAR JAR pops out of an open door.
JAR JAR Hidoe!
Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The Gungan is embarrassed that he frightened them.
JAR JAR (Cont’d) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
PADME That’s all right.
JAR JAR I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.
JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.
JAR JAR Mesa Ja Ja Binksss...
PADME I’m Padme, I attend Her Highness, You’re a Gungan, aren’t you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with us?
JAR JAR Me no know... mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning munchen. Den boom... getten berry skeered, un grabbed dat Jedi, and before mesa knowen it... pow! Mesa here. (he shrugs)... getten berry berry skeered.
ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE’S shoulder. A large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.
OBI-WAN That’s it. Tatooine.
RIC OLIE There’s a settlement... a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON Land near the outskirts. We don’t want to attract any attention.
EXT. TATOOINE – SPACE (FX)
The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY (FX) The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN AREA
OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up to him and falls to his knees.
JAR JAR Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!

OBI-WAN Sorry, Qui-Gon’s right. You’ll make things less obvious. JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer) enters the main area.
OBI-WAN (Cont’d) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new one.
QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him. QUI-GON Don’t let them send ant transmissions. Be wary... I sense a disturbance in the Force.
OBI-WAN I fell it also, Master.
QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head to the exit ramp.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – SPACESHIP – DAY
They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.
JAR JAR Dis sun doen murder tada skin.
From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.
CAPT. PANAKA Wait!
QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant’s garb.
CAPT. PANAKA (Cont’d) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. She wishes for her to observe the local... QUI-GON No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant...
CAPT. PANAKA The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
PADME I’ve been trained in defense... I can take care of myself. CAPT. PANAKA Don’t make me go back and tell her you refuse. QUI-GON I don’t have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay close to me.
He gives PADME a stern look.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – DAY
The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this exotic environment.
QUI-GON ... moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for those who do not wish to be found...
PADME ... like us.

JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic. ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.
JAR JAR Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze) Ooooh... icky... icky... goo.
EXT. MOS ESPA – JUNK DEALER PLAZA – DAY
The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship dealers.
QUI-GON We’ll try one of the smaller dealers.
They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships stacked up behind it.
INT. WATTO’S JUNK SHOP – DAY
QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a hummingbird.
WATTO (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?) QUI-GON I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
WATTO Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk? (subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!) QUI-GON My droid here has a readout of what I need.
A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and ANAKIN flinches.
WATTO (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?) ANAKIN (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like you... )
WATTO (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the store) Me dwana no bata. (I’ve got some selling to do here.) (to Qui-Gon) Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you’ll find what you need.
ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.
QUI-GON Don’t touch anything.
JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON’s back and sticks out his long tongue. ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME. She is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile. Finally, he gets the courage to speak. ANAKIN Are you an angel?

PADME What?
ANAKIN An angel. I’ve heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the Moons of Iego I think. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry.
PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say.
PADME I’ve never heard of angels.
ANAKIN You must be one... maybe you just don’t know it.
PADME You’re a funny little boy. How do you know so much? ANAKIN Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto, who’s a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
PADME You’re... a slave?
ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.
ANAKIN I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME I’m sorry. I don’t fully understand. (looking around) This is a strange world to me.
ANAKIN studies her intently.
ANAKIN You are a strange girl to me.
JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around, knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can’t stop it.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Hit the nose!
JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair.
EXT. WATTO’S JUNK YARD – BEHIND SHOP – DAY
WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a hyperdrive.
WATTO ... Here it is... a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I’m the only one hereabouts who has one... but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think... Sying of which, how’s thee going to pay for all this?
QUI-GON I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real...
QUI-GON I don’t have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will do fine.
WATTO No they won’ta.

QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again.
QUI-GON Credits will do fine.
WATTO No, they won’ta. What you think you’re some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I’m a Toydarian. Mind tricks don’ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.
INT. WATTO’S JUNK SHOP – DAY
JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all come tumbling down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down. ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.
ANAKIN ... wouldn’t have lasted long if I weren’t so good at fixing things. I’m making my own droid...
QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO.
QUI-GON We’re leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look. PADME I’m glad I met you... ah...
ANAKIN ... Anakin.
PADME Anakin.
ANAKIN Anakin Skywalker.
PADME Padme Naberrie.
PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave. ANAKIN I’m glad I met you too.
WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.
WATTO (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia. (Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don’t know nothing.)
ANAKIN (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO (subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you can go home.)
ANAKIN lets out a “yipee” and runs out the back.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – ALCOVE – DAY
QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.
QUI-GON ... Obi-Wan, you’re sure there isn’t anything of value left on board?
OBI-WAN (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen’s wardrobe, maybe. Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the amounts you’re

talking about.
QUI-GON All right. Another solution will present itself. I’ll check back. QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR grabs his arm.
JAR JAR Noah gain... da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched.
QUI-GON Not likely. We have nothing of value, that’s our problem. EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – MARKET – DAY
QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looking, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth. Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly appears.
VENDOR Hey, that will be seven truguts!!
JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets around the market, and lands in Sebulba’s soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan.
SEBULBA (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!)
JAR JAR Who, mesa??
SEBULBA (subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)
SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety.
JAR JAR (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN (V.O) Because you’re afraid.
JAR JAR turns to see ANAKIN pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.
ANAKIN (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba... Coo wolpa tooney
rana. (Careful, Sebulba... This one’s very connected.)
SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN. SEBULBA (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko,
shag. (Connected?? Whada you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN (subtitled) Oh da Hutt... cha porko ootman geesa... me teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt... big time outlander, this one... I’d hate to see you diced before we race again.) SEBULBA (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma

klounkee (Next time we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom. (If you weren’t a slave, I’d squash you right now.)
SEBULBA turns away.
ANAKIN (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it’d be a pity if you had to pay for me.)
QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.
JAR JAR Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat’s da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON Nevertheless, the boy is right... you were heading for trouble. Thank you, my young friend.
PADME looks at ANAKIN and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down the crowded street.
JAR JAR Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you... be less afraid.
PADME And that works for you.
ANAKIN To a point. (he smiles)
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – SPACESHIP – DAY
OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.
OBI-WAN This storm’s going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA It looks pretty bad. We’d better seal the ship. CAPTAIN PANAKA’S comlink sounds off.
CAPT. PANAKA (Cont’d) Yes?
CAPT. PANAKA We’ll be right there.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – FRUIT STAND – DAY
ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor, old lady named JIRA.
ANAKIN How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA The heat’s never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN Guess what? I’ve found that cooling unit I’ve been searching for. It’s pretty beat up, but I’ll have it fixed up for you in no time, I promise.
JIRA You’re a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN I’ll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You’ll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one. QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsaber.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Whoops, I thought I had more... Make that three, I’m not hungry.
The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA gives them their pallies.
JIRA Gracious, my bones are aching... storm’s coming on, Annie. You’d better get home quick.
ANAKIN (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter? QUI-GON We’ll head back to our ship. ANAKIN Is it far?
PADME On the outskirts.
ANAKIN You’ll never reach the outskirts in time... sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!
The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street. EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – STREET – SANDSTORM – DAY
The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down the street and into a slave hovel.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.
ANAKIN Mom! Mom! I’m home.
JAR JAR Dissen cozy.
Anakin’s mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.
SHMI Oh, my!! Annie, what’s this?
ANAKIN These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and... gee, I don’t know any of your names.
QUI-GON I’m Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a little beep.
PADME ... and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
ANAKIN I’m building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI Anakin! Why are they here?
ANAKIN A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.
The wind HOWLS outside.
QUI-GON Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way. QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to SHMI.
QUI-GON I have enough food for a meal.
SHMI Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I’m sorry if I was abrupt. I’ll never get used to Anakin’s surprises.
QUI-GON He’s a very special boy.
SHMI looks at him as if he’s discovered a secret.
SHMI Yes, I know.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – BEDROOM – DAY
ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.
ANAKIN Isn’t he great?! He’s not finished yet.
PADME He’s wonderful!
ANAKIN You really like him? He’s a protocol droid... to help Mom. Watch!
ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.
THREEPIO How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you?
PADME He’s perfect.
ANAKIN When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I’m building a Podracer!
PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO I beg your pardon...what do you mean I’m naked? ARTOO BEEPS
THREEPIO (Cont’d) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing!
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – QUEENS CHAMBERS
AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram.
BIBBLE ... cut off all food supplies until you return... the death toll is catastrophic... we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness... Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...
AMIDALA looks upset... almost nervous.
OBI-WAN It’s a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.
OBI-WAN ... the Queen is upset... but absolutely no reply was sent. QUI-GON It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace. OBI-WAN What if it is true and the people are dying?
QUI-GON Either way, we’re running out of time.
EXT. CORUSCANT – BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY – NIGHT DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city. DARTH MAUL Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS Move against the Jedi first... you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.
The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the city.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SANDSTORM – DAY
The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto’s ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin’s house.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside. JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a little brighter red.
SHMI All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
ANAKIN I’ve been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck.
SHMI Any attempt to escape...
ANAKIN ... and they blow you up... poof!
PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.
JAR JAR How wude.
PADME I can’t believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The

Republic’s anti-slavery laws...
SHMI The Republic doesn’t exist out here... we must survive on our own.
An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment. ANAKIN Have you ever seen a Podrace?
PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.
QUI-GON They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
ANAKIN I’m the only human who can do it.
SHMI looks askance at her son.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Mom, what? I’m not bragging. It’s true. Watto says he’s never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.
ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Don’t do that again.
JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR’s mouth. ANAKIN I... I was wondering... something...
QUI-GON What?
ANAKIN Well, ahhh... you’re a Jedi Knight, aren’t you?
QUI-GON What makes you think that?
ANAKIN I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon. QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.
QUI-GON Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN I don’t think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON I wish that were so...
ANAKIN I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves... have you come to free us?
QUI-GON No, I’m afraid not...
ANAKIN I think you have... why else would you be here?
QUI-GON thinks for a moment.
QUI-GON I can see there’s no fooling you... (leans forward) You mustn’t let anyone know about us... we’re on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept secret.
ANAKIN Coruscant... wow... how did you end up here in the outer

rim?
PADME Our ship was damaged, and we’re stranded here until we can repair it.
ANAKIN I can help! I can fix anything!
QUI-GON I believe you can, but our first job is to acquire the parts we need...
JAR JAR Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind. SHMI Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.
QUI-GON Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it’s used properly.
ANAKIN I’ve built a racer! It’s the fastest ever... There’s a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It’s all but finished...
SHMI Anakin, settle down. Watto won’t let you...
ANAKIN Watto doesn’t know I’ve built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him think it’s yours, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.
SHMI I don’t want you to race, Annie... It’s awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
ANAKIN But Mom, I love it... and they need help... they’re in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
JAR JAR Wesa ina pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON Your mother’s right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us?
SHMI shakes her head no.
ANAKIN We have to help them, Mom... you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other...
SHMI Anakin, don’t...
JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat. PADME I’m sure Qui-Gon doesn’t want to put your son in danger. We will find another way...
SHMI No, Annie’s right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but he can help you... he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN Is that a yes? That is a yes!
The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.
EXT. MOS ESPA – JUNK DEALER PLAZA – DAY
The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up

the mess and rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto’s parts shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing next to him. PADME stops QUI- GON as he is about to enter the shop.
PADME Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON The Queen does not need to know.
PADME Well, I don’t approve.
QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.
INT. WATTO’S JUNK SHOP – DAY
WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.
WATTO Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN No batta!
WATTO Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
ANAKIN Bayno, Bayno!
QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.
WATTO The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can’t afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)
QUI-GON My ship will be the entry fee.
QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of WATTO. He studies it.
WATTO Not bad... not bad... a Nubian.
QUI-GON It’s in good order, except for the parts we need.
WATTO ... but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it.
ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.
ANAKIN Ahhhh... it wasn’t my fault really... Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod... mostly.
WATTO (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there. QUI-GON I have... acquired a Pod in a game of chance. “The fastest ever built.”
WATTO I hope you didn’t kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.
QUI-GON Fifty-fifty!?! If it’s going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need... If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous. QUI-GON (Cont’d) Either way, you win.
WATTO (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.)
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – TATOOINE DESERT – DAY
OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink. QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.
OBI-WAN What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a long time.
QUI-GON (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and there is something about this boy...
EXT MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – PORCH – DAY
QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch. PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in the courtyard below.
QUI-GON You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.
SHMI He knows nothing of greed. He has...
QUI-GON He has special powers.
SHMI Yes...
QUI-GON He can see things before they happen. That’s why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI He deserves better than a slave’s life.
QUI-GON The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father?
SHMI There was no father, that I know of... I carried him, I gave him birth... I can’t explain what happened. Can you help him?
QUI-GON I’m afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt... he has the way. But it’s too late for him now, he’s too old. EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – BACK YARD – DAY KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin’s age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring. ANAKIN Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and Seek, Amee, and Wald.
All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.
KITSTER Wow, a real Astro Droid... how’d you get so lucky? ANAKIN This isn’t the half of it. I’m entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!

KITSTER What? With this??
WALD (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. (You are such a joke, Annie.) AMEE You’ve been working on that thing for years. It’s never going to run.
SEEK Come on, let’s go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you’re gonna be bug squash.
SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of the energy binder plates.
ANAKIN Hey! Jar jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR Who, mesa?
ANAKIN If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.
JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled.
JAR JAR Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER But you don’t even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN It will.
QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can’t get words out that make sense.
QUI-GON I think it’s time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN Yes, sir!!
ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – PORCH – DAY
SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.
EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS – BALCONY – NIGHT
ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.
QUI-GON Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets? QUI-GON Most of them.
ANAKIN Has anyone been to them all?
QUI-G0N (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!
QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN’S arm.

QUI-GON There, good as new...
SHMI yells from inside the hovel.
SHMI (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!
QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN’s blood onto a comlink chip. ANAKIN What are you doing?
QUI-GON Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN I’ve never seen...
SHMI (O.S.) Annie! I’m not going to tell you again!
QUI-GON Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight. ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI- WAN.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN Yes, Master.
QUI-GON Make an analysis of this blood sample I’m sending you. OBI-WAN Wait a minute...
QUI-GON I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN All right. I’ve got it.
QUI-GON What are your readings?
OBI-WAN Something must be wrong with the transmission. QUI-GON Here’s a signal check.
OBI-WAN Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the reading’s off the chart... over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON (almost to himself) That’s it then.
OBI-WAN Even Master Yoda doesn’t have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN What does it mean?
QUI-GON I’m not sure.
The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him. Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the situation.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT MESA – NIGHT
The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dusk, scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on his electronic armband. Six football- sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three different directions toward the cities. DARTH MAUL stands on the

mesa and watches them through his electrobinoculars.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – PORCH – SUNRISE
Padme exits the hovel.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – BACK YARD – SUNRISE
As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod. ANAKIN is asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.
PADME I hope you’re about finished.
ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on an EOPIE, a strange camel-like creature. He is leading a second EOPIE behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he sleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up, yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.
ANAKIN: You were in my dream... you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and clean up. We have to leave soon.
ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as KITSTER arrives.
ANAKIN Hook ‘em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won’t be long. Where’s Qui-Gon?
PADME He and Jar jar left already. They’re with Watto at the arena. EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.
WATTO ... I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over. QUI-GON Patience, my blue friend. You’ll have your winnings before the suns set, and we’ll be far away from here.
WATTO Not if your ship belongs to me, I think... I warn you, no funny business.
QUI-GON You don’t think Anakin will win?
WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA. WATTO Don’t get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He’s a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think. QUI-GON Why?
WATTO He always wins. (laughs) I’m betting heavily on Sebulba.

QUI-GON I’ll take that bet.
WATTO (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean? QUI-GON I’ll wager my new racing pod against... say... the boy and his mother.
WATTO A Pod for slaves. I don’t think so... well, perhaps. Just one... the mother, maybe... the boy isn’t for sale.
QUI-GON The boy is small, he can’t be worth much.
WATTO shakes his head.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) For the fastest Pod ever built?!
WATTO shakes his head again.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Both, or no bet.
WATTO No Pod’s worth two slaves... not by a long shot... one slave or nothing.
QUI-GON The boy, then...
WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.
WATTO We’ll let fate decide. Blue it’s the boy, red his mother... WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue. QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.
WATTO (Cont’d) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won’t win the race, so... it makes little difference.
ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine. KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.
WATTO (Cont’d) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd. (Better stop your friends betting, or I’ll end up owning him, too.)
WATTO walks off, laughing.
ANAKIN What did he mean by that?
QUI-GON I’ll tell you later.
ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.
THREEPIO Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.
ARTOO emits a series of beeps.
THREEPIO I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!
KITSTER (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I’m sure you’ll do it this time, Annie.
PADME Do what?
KITSTER Finish the race, of course!

PADME You’ve never won a race? ANAKIN Well... not exactly... PADME Not even finished?! ANAKN looks sheepish.
ANAKIN ... but Kitster’s right, I will this time.
QUI-GON Of course you will.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – DAY
One of Darth Maul’s PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, or the QUEEN.
EXT. MOS ESPA – DESERT RACE ARENA – DAY
An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the racetrack.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA ANNOUNCER’S BOX – DAY (FX)
A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.
FODE/BEED A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces. (We have perfect weather today for the Boonta classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.) B: That’s absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.
EXT. MOS ESPA – DESERT RACE ARENA – DAY
On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box.
FODE/BEED (O.S) A: La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!) B: I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system. A: ... eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in the new Ord Pedrovia.) B: Two time winner, Boles Roor... A: Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya bookie ookie!! (On the front line the reigning champion, Sebulba from Pixelito. By far the favorite
today.) B: And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy. A: Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.) B: I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – GRANDSTAND – DAY
Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell

barbecued creature parts and colorful drinks.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – ROYAL BOX – DAY (FX)
All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and waves to the crowd.
FODE/BEED A: O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah parena. (His honor, our glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the arena.)
The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along with humans and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are led alongside JABBA.
JABBA (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda hodrudda du wundee. (Welcome!) Sebulba tuta Pixelito... EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – STARTING GRID – DAY
SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer. KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin’s Pod with a long cable. SHMI gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye. SHMI Be safe.
ANAKIN I will, Mom. I promise.
She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.
JABBA ... Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin Skywalker tuta Tatooine...
The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin’s engines. KITSTER and JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.
JAR JAR Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo. PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheek. SEBULBA bangs on a part protruding from Anakin’s engine. He looks around to see if anyone has noticed.
PADME You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN I won’t let you down.
PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a sinister grin.
SEBULBA Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. (You won’t walk away from this one, slave scum! You’re Bantha poodoo.)
ANAKIN (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don’t count on it, slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI- GON approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.
JABBA (sutitled) ... Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (... Let the challenge begin!)
The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy straps himself into the tiny racer.
QUI-GON Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don’t think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the Force be with you.
QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – STARTING GRID – DAY
The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. Aliens carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.
JAR JAR Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE/BEED A: Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings are being activated) B: Hey, it looks like they’re clearing the grid. EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – VIEWING PLATFORM – DAY
SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a viewing platform. PADME and JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.
SHMI Is he nervous?
QUI-GON He’s fine.
PADME You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
QUI-GON The Queen trusts my judgement, young handmaiden. You should too.
PADME You assume too much.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA ANNOUNCER’S BOX – DAY (FX) FODE/BEED B: Start your engines.
The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening. EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – ROYAL BOX – DAY (FX)
Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the start of the race.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – STARTING GRID – DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN’S engine floods and coughs – then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around him and disappear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer started. The two-headed announcer reports. FODE/BEED (O.S.) A: An dare ovv! (And they’re off!) B: Oh... wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.
PADME and JAR JAR are very disappointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin’s engines ignite. He zooms away after the receding pack of competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the race as it progresses. FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: And there goes Skywalker... He’ll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders today.
EXT. MOS ESPA – RACETRACK – DAY (FX)
The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke. ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily. One of the drivers, GASGANO, won’t let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side and is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAKIN accelerates so fast that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away. Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of Anakin’s Pod.
FODE/BEED B: Looks like a few Tusken Raiders have camped out on the canyon dune turn.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – VIEWING PLATFORM – DAY
JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small, hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange alien named FANTA.
JAR JAR Where’s Skywalker?
FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar jar’s view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON watch another screen and look worried. ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA – RACETRACK – DAY (FX)
ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by another racer, XELBREE. SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side vent on the racer’s engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the alien’s engine. The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly veers away. ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump. One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the whole thing EXPLODES.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – VIEWING PLATFORM – DAY
QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information. The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in Anakin’s defeat. The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS. KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.
FODE/BEED (O.S) B: There goes Quadinaros’ power couplings. A: Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)
QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA.
JAR JAR What gooie-on?
FANTA Bug off.
Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME look worried.
JAR JAR He musta crash-ud.
PADME Here he comes!
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – PIT AREA – DAY (FX)
ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells. THREEPIO He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear! EXT. MOS ESPA – RACETRACK – DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack. The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He’s in... A: Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.) ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is unbearable. ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze, then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) A: Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for some attention.) ODY: Droids!
TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off his Pod, sending it into Terter’s engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN, and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin’s engines that links the Pod to his engines. ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly. As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it. Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod. SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flies into the cloud of dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B:At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker...
ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third and last lap. WATTO begins to worry. SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin’s engines. ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off course.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp! A: Oh noah!
On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead. FODE BEED (O.S.) B: Amazing... a controlled thrust and he’s back on course! What a move!
SEBULBA is furious. He stay’s right on Anakin’s tail, crowding him

and pushing him through the turns. SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin’s engines begins to shake loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him. ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes, SEBULBA is able to block. Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race side by side down the final stretch of the track. FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: He’s catching Sebulba. A:
Inkabunga. (Incredible!)
SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: That little human being is out of his mind. A: Punda tah punda! (They’re neck and neck!) B: They’re side by
side! A: Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)
As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN’s steering arm breaks, and his Pod starts spinning. The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened, but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws what’s left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down with excitement, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line, the winner.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX – DAY (FX)
The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.
FODE/BEED B: It’s Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in tandem with partner)
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – DAY
As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off, CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul’s PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.

INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – PRIVATE BOX – DAY
Several ALIENS leave Watto’s box, laughing and counting their money. WATTO sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.
WATTO You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.
WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI- GON’s. QUI-GON simply smiles.
QUI-GON Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you’ll lose. Bring the parts to the main hanger. I’ll come by your shop later so you can release the boy.
WATTO You can’t have him! It wasn’t a fair bet!
QUI-GON Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts... I’m sure they can settle this.
WATTO No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!
The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug, then SHMI.
ANAKIN Ah, gee... enough of this...
SHMI It’s so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have none. I’m so very proud of you...
PADME We owe you everything.
ANAKIN Just feeling this good was worth it.
In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to containers full of parts.
QUI-GON Padme. Jar jar, let’s go, we’ve got to get these parts back to the ship.
The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES. PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE, only to slowly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI wave as they ride off.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) I’ll return the eopies by midday.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES; JAR JAR rides the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft. OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.
QUI-GON Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I’m going

back... some unfinished business. I won’t be long.
OBI-WAN Why do I sense we’ve picked up another pathetic life form... ?
QUI-GON It’s the boy who’s responsible for getting those parts.
On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns and speeds away.
EXT. TATOOINE – STREET – SLAVE QUARTERS – DAY
ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GON is towering above them. KITSTER is with them.
QUI-GON What’s this?
ANAKIN He said I cheated.
QUI-GON Did you?
ANAKIN No!
QUI-GON Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO Yes.
QUI-GON Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his opinion, fighting won’t change it.
QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over to WALD who has been watching the goings-on. WALD Keep this up, Greedo, and you’re gonna come to a bad end. Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin’s hovel. QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them to the boy.
QUI-GON These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN (suddenly beaming) Yes!
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.
ANAKIN Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have! ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.
SHMI Oh, my goodness, That’s wonderful.
QUI-GON And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN What?!?
QUI-GON You’re no longer a slave.
ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.
ANAKIN Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize, or what?

QUI-GON Let’s just say Watto has learned an important lesson about gambling.
SHMI Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You’re free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
QUI-GON Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident. You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Council.
ANAKIN A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your starship and everything?!
QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.
QUI-GON Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
ANAKIN But it’s what I want. What I’ve always dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?!
QUI-GON This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it is yours alone.
ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.
ANAKIN I want to go.
QUI-GON Then, pack your things. We haven’t much time.
ANAKIN Yipee!!
ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) What about Mom? Is she free too? You’re coming, aren’t you, Mom?
QUI-GON I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn’t have it.
ANAKIN But the money from selling...
QUI-GON It’s not nearly enough.
SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands in hers, she draws him close.
SHMI Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go... to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN I want to stay with you. I don’t want things to change.
SHMI You can’t stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what’s right. ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears in his eyes.

ANAKIN I’m going to miss you so much, Mom...
SHMI I love you, Annie... now hurry.
ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.
SHMI (Cont’d) Thank you.
QUI-GON I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
SHMI He was in my life for such a short time.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – SECOND ROOM – DAY
ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he leaves, he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up. THREEPIO stares at him blankly.
ANAKIN Well, Threepio, I’m free... and I’m going away... in a starship...
THREEPIO Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although I’d like it better if I were a little less naked.
ANAKIN I’m sorry I wasn’t able to finish you, Threepio... give you coverings and all... I’m going to miss working on you. You’ve been a great pal. I’ll make sure Mom doesn’t sell you or anything. Bye. THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room. THREEPIO Sell me?!?
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – SLAVE QUARTERS – DAY KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin’s hovel. SHMI stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket and gives them to KITSTER.
KITSTER There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You’re a hero.
ANAKIN I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.
QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.
KITSTER Well.
ANAKIN Well.
KITSTER Thanks for every moment you’ve been here. You’re my best friend.
ANAKIN I won’t forget.
ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and runs back to his mother.
ANAKIN (starting to cry) I can’t do it, Mom. I just can’t.
SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and looks him in the face.
SHMI Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to

chase the Banthas away so they wouldn’t be shot... Remember how you collapses several times, exhausted thinking you couldn’t do it? ANAKIN shakes his head.
SHMI (Cont’d) This is one of those times when you have to do something you don’t think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you can do this...
ANAKIN Will I ever see you again?
SHMI What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN I hope so... yes... I guess.
SHMI Then we will see each other again.
ANAKIN I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom... I promise.
SHMI No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and don’t look back... don’t look back.
ANAKIN I love you so much.
SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look back.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT MESA – DAY
The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH LORD gets on a speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into Mos Espa.
EXT MOS ESPA – STREET – FRUIT STAND – DAY
ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO’S and stop before JIRA’S fruit stand. ANAKIN hands JIRA some coins.
ANAKIN I’ve been freed, and I’m going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit with this... Otherwise I’ll worry about you.
JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say. JIRA Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN Sure.
She gives him a hug.
JIRA I’ll miss you, Annie.. there isn’t a kinder boy in the galaxy. You be careful...
ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of his eye. Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

ANAKIN What is it?
QUI-GON Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I’ve seen before. Come on.
QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard time keeping up.
ANAKIN Master Qui-Gon, sir, wait!
QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a speeder bike.
QUI-GON Anakin, drop!
ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord has swung a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by QUI-GON. ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloud of dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up, bewildered by the confrontation.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go! QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to the ship.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – HALLWAY
ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME and CAPTAIN PANAKA are working.
ANAKIN Qui-Gon’s in trouble. He says to take off... now!!
CAPT. PANAKA Who are you?
PADME He’s a friend.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where OBI-WAN and RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.
CAPT. PANAKA Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
PILOT I don’t see anything.
OBI-WAN Over there! Fly low!
In the distance is a small cloud of dust.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue their sword battle. Leaping over one another in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warriors hear the ship fly over them a few feet off the ground. QUI- GON almost disappears for a moment. Before DARTH MAUL knows

what’s happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecraft’s ramp.
EXT. TATOOINE – NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP – DAY
The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop. QUI-GON swings his laser sword with all his might and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and onto the desert floor. The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away, leaving the Sith Lord standing alone.
EXT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)
The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – HALLWAY
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt. ANAKIN Are you all right?
QUI-GON I think so... that was a surprise I wont soon forget. OBI-WAN What was it?
QUI-GON I don’t know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen...
ANAKIN Do you think he’ll follow us?
QUI-GON We’ll be safe enough once we’re in hyperspace, but I have no doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN What are we going to do about it?
OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a “who are you?” look. ANAKIN returns an innocent stare.
QUI-GON We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
ANAKIN Pleased to meet you. Wow! You’re a Jedi too?
OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.
INT. COCKPIT – SPACE
RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch.
QUI-GON Let’s hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn’t get the last laugh.
The stars streak outside the cockpit window.
EXT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)
The ship streaks into hyperspace.
EXT. THEED – STREET – NIGHT (FX)
SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The Palace can be seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM – THEED – NIGHT
NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind. DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch.
NUTE When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I’m afraid. Take him away! BIBBLE This invasion will gain you nothing. We’re a democracy. The people have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.
BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.
OOM-9 My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN AREA
The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room. She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he rests. PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking very dejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm.
PADME Are you all right?
ANAKIN It’s very cold.
PADME gives him her over-jacket.
PADME You’re from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is cold.
ANAKIN You seem sad.
PADME The Queen is... worried. Her people are suffering... dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, or... I’m not sure what will happen.
ANAKIN I’m... I’m not sure what’s going to happen to me. I dunno if I’ll ever see you again... (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for you. So you’d remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune.
ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it around her neck.
PADME It’s beautiful, but I don’t need this to remember you. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for

you will always remain.
ANAKIN I care for you too. Only I... miss...
ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.
PADME ... You miss your mother.
ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.
EXT. SPACE – PLANET CORUSCANT (FX)
MOVE with the ship as it heads toward Coruscant.
INT. CORUSCANT – CITYSCAPE – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY (FX)
The spacecraft flies over the endless cityscape of Coruscant, the capital of the galaxy.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.
RIC OLIE Coruscant... the capital of the Republic... the entire planet is one big city.
ANAKIN Wow! It’s so huge!
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY (FX)
The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.
EXT. CORUSCANT – SENATE LANDING PLATFORM – DAY Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on a landing platform. The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM. CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group. ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.
PALPATINE It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I’ve called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position.
AMIDALA I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.
PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform toward a waiting air taxi.
PALPATINE There is a question of procedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI- WAN and QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead. ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.
JAR JAR Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around) Pitty hot!
VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city. QUI-GON I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately, Your Honor. The situation has become more complicated.
INT. PALPATINE’S QUARTERS – ANTEROOM – DAY
QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be seen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what is being said.
JAR JAR Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN Don’t look at me. I don’t know what’s going on.
CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.
INT. PALPATINE’S QUARTERS – LIVING AREA – DAY PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one side.
PALPATINE ... the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home systems. There is no interest in the common good... no civility, only politics... it’s disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope. PALPATINE If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power... he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA What options do we have?
PALPATINE Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

AMIDALA He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
PALPATINE Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...
AMIDALA There’s no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator... more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE To be realistic, Your Highness, I’d say we’re going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA There is something I cannot do.
EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI – DAY (FX)
A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.
INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI – COUNCIL CHAMBERS – DAY QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi- circle. OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room. The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.
QUI-GON ... my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord. MACE WINDU A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millennium. YODA The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are. MACE WINDU I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
KI-ADI I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the Queen is the target.
YODA With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her. MACE WINDU We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
YODA May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council. YODA (Cont’d) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in the Force.
YODA A vergence, you say?

MACE WINDU Located around a person?
QUI-GON A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi- chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU You’re referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force... you believe it’s this boy??
QUI-GON I don’t presume...
YODA But you do! Revealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON I request the boy be tested.
The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI- WAN and QUI-GON.
YODA Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON Finding him was the will of the Force... I have no doubt of that. There is too much happening here...
MACE WINDU Bring him before us, then.
YODA Tested he will be.
INT. QUEENS QUARTERS – CORUSCANT – DAY
Anakin, tentative, walks down one of the long hallways in Senator Palpatine’s quarters. He stops before a door that is flanked by TWO GUARDS.
GUARD May I help you, son?
ANAKIN I’m... I’m looking for the handmaiden, Padme.
The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.
GUARD The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE Send him in.
The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen’s quarters. RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.
ANAKIN I’d like to speak with Padme, if I could.
RABE I’m sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.
The Queen speaks out in the next room.
AMIDALA (O.S.) Who is it?
RABE Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.
The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks down, then takes a peek at her.
AMIDALA I’ve sent Padme on an errand.
ANAKIN I’m going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.
The QUEEN just stares at him.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I may not see her again... and... I just wanted to

say goodbye.
AMIDALA We will tell her for you. We’re sure her heart goes with you. ANAKIN bows again.
ANAKIN Thank you, Your Highness. I’m sorry to have disturbed you. The QUEEN disappears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits. EXT. CORUSCANT – GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING – DAY (FX) A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape of Coruscant.
INT. MAIN ROTUNDA – GALACTIC SENATE – DAY
The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in the center. Hundreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans over to the QUEEN.
PALPATINE If the Federation moves to defer the motion... Your Majesty, I beg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor... I promise you there are many who will support us... it is our best chance... Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA You truly believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion to a vote?
PALAPATINE He is distracted... he is afraid. He will be of no help. VALORUM The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.
The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.
PALPATINE Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occurred on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caught in a dispute you’re all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.
A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.
LOTT DOD This is outrageous! I object to the Senator’s statements! VALORUM The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.
PALPATINE To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.
QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.
AMIDALA Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force. Invaded... against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the Trade...
LOTT DOD I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth. VALORUM Overruled.
LOTT DOD Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without reasonable observation. It’s against all the rules of procedure. A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.
AKS MOE The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed... that is the law.
VALORUM The point...
VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA. PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN. PALPATINE Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum’s strength will disappear.
VALORUM The point is conceded... Section 523A take precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations? QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.
AMIDALA (angrily) I will not defer... I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a “vote of no confidence”... in Chancellor Valorum’s leadership.
VALORUM What?... No!
This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud murmur crescendos into a roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA,

takes over.
MAS AMEDDA Order! We shall have order...
Things settle down a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA. PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena. BAIL ORGANA Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.
MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.
BAIL ORGANA There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures committee for study.
The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA. ASSEMBLY Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!
PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.
PALPATINE You see, Your Majesty, the tide is with us... Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA The Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will begin the vote.
The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.
VALORUM Palpatine, I thought you were my ally... my friend. You have betrayed me! How could you do this?
EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI – BALCONY – SUNSET
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony. OBI-WAN The boy will not pass the Council’s tests, Master, and you know it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON Anakin will become A Jedi... I promise you.
OBI-WAN Don’t defy the Council, Master... not again.
QUI-GON I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time. QUI-GON You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.
INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI – COUNCIL CHAMBERS – SUNSET ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN A ship... a cup... a speeder.
MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA. YODA Good, good, young one. How feel you?
ANAKIN Cold, sir.
YODA Afraid are you?
ANAKIN No, sir.
MACE WINDU Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN I don’t think so.
ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.
YODA See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN I miss her.
YODA Afraid to lose her... I think.
ANAKIN (a little angry) What’s that got to do with anything?
YODA Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA Then continue, we will.
INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS – SUNSET
QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.
JAR JAR Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA I don’t know.
JAR JAR Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA I hope not.
JAR JAR Gungans do die’n without a fight... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.
PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the room and bow before the QUEEN.
CAPT. PANAKA Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise,

Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I will put an end to corruption. The Trade Federation will lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed. AMIDALA Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE I feel confident... our “situation” will create a strong sympathy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor. AMIDALA With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do here... Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people. PALPATINE Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain!
CAPT. PANAKA Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA Ready my ship!
CAPT. PANAKA Please, Your Majesty, stay here... where it’s safe. AMIDALA No place is safe, if the Senate doesn’t condemn this invasion. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.
AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self- satisfied smile on his face.
INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI – COUNCIL CHAMBERS – TWILIGHT ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI COUNCIL.
YODA ... Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU His cells contain a high concentration of midi- chlorians.
KI-ADI The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON He’s to be trained, then.
The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.
MACE WINDU No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.
QUI-GON No??!!
OBI-WAN smiles.
MACE WINDU He is too old. There is already too much anger in him. QUI-GON He is the chosen one... you must see it.
YODA Clouded, this boy’s future is. Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner. OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.
YODA An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU We forbid it.
QUI-GON Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN I am ready to face the trials.
YODA Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks. QUI-GON Headstrong... and he has much to learn about the living Force, but he is capable. There is little more he will learn from me. YODA Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
MACE WINDU Now is not the time for this... the Senate is voting for a new Supreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA And draw out the Queen’s attacker.
KI-ADI Events are moving fast... too fast.
MACE WINDU Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.
YODA Young Skywalker’s fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere else to go.
MACE WINDU He is your ward, Qui-Gon... we will not dispute that. YODA Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war until we have the Senate’s approval.
YODA May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.
EXT. CORUSCANT – SENATE LANDING PLATFORM – NIGHT QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the

edge of the platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his on- board jets to propel himself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he listens to the JEDI.
OBI-WAN It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON From your point of view...
OBI-WAN The boy is dangerous... they all sense it. Why can’t you? QUI-GON His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide Anakin’s future... that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem. QUI-GON You won’t be, Annie... I’m not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful... always remember, your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe. ANAKIN Master, sir... I’ve been wondering... what are midi- chlorians?
QUI-GON Midi-chlorians are a microscopic lifeform that reside within all living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN They live inside of me?
QUI-GON In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians. ANAKIN Symbionts?
QUI-GON Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN They do??
QUI-GON When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.
ANAKIN I don’t understand.
QUI-GON With time and training, Annie... you will.
Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.
AMIDALA I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the

Federation means to destroy me.
QUI-GON I promise you, I will not let that happen.
AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON and ANAKIN.
JAR JAR Wesa goen home!
They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.
INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM – THEED – NIGHT
NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS. DARTH SIDIOUS The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
NUTE Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS Viceroy, is the planet secure?
NUTE Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
DARTH SIDIOUS Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
NUTE Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.
RUNE A Sith lord here with us?!!
INT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT
ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and gauges.
ANAKIN ... and that one?
RIC OLIE The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE You catch on pretty quick.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – QUEEN’S CHAMBERS
SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch. CAPT. PANAKA The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON I agree... I’m not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA I’m going to take back what’s ours.
CAPT. PANAKA There are only twelve of us, Your Highness... we have no army.
QUI-GON I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.
JAR JAR Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA Yes. I need your help.
INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT – DAY
The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on the view screen.
PANAKA The blockade’s gone.
OBI-WAN The war’s over... No need for it now.
RIC OLIE I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN A droid control ship.
PANAKA They’ve probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN We haven’t much time.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN HOLD
The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark as the ship lands. The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into the hold area. He see PADME and run up to her.
ANAKIN Hi! Where have you been?
PADME Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN I’m with Qui-Gon... but... they’re not going to let me be a Jedi. I’m too old.
PADME This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME To war, I’m afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficult decision of her life. She doesn’t believe in fighting, Annie. We are a peaceful people...
ANAKIN I want to help... I’m glad you’re back.
ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.
EXT. NABOO SWAMP – DAY
The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI- GON.
OBI-WAN Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master. QUI-GON’s thoughts are elsewhere.
QUI-GON Good.
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.
OBI-WAN Do you think the Queen’s idea will work?
QUI-GON The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power to help her.

OBI-WAN I’m... I’m sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the trials.
QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.
QUI-GON You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than I am, Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight. EXT. NABOO SWAMP – UNDERWATER – DAY (FX)
JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.
INT. OTOH GUNGA – CITY SQUARE
JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands, stunned, in amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.
JAR JAR Ello! Where das everybody?
The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if there had been a battle of some kind.
EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE – DAY
JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, FOUR PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.
JAR JAR Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry, no Gungas... no Gungas.
CAPT. PANAKA Do you think they have been taken to camps? OBI-WAN More likely they were wiped out.
JAR JAR No... mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON Do you know where they are?
EXT. NABOO SWAMP – DAY
The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.
JAR JAR Dissen it.
JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CAPTAIN TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.
JAR JAR (Cont’d) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
CAPT. TARPALS Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR We comen to see da boss.
CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.
CAPT. TARPALS Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse. EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS – DAY
JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-

WAN, PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the top of a three- quarter-submerged head.
BOSS NASS Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who’s da uss-en others??
QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.
AMIDALA I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo... I come before you in peace.
BOSS NASS Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die’n, mesa tink. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously, and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed. ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.
AMIDALA We wish to form an alliance... Suddenly, PADME steps forward. PADME Your Honor...
ARTOO whistles a quiet “uh oh.”
BOSS NASS Whosa dis?
PADME I am Queen Amidala. (points to Queen) This is my decoy... my protection... my loyal bodyguard.
ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.
PADME (Cont’d) ... I am sorry for my deception, but under the circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace... until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever... I ask you to help us... no, I beg you to help us.
PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS. There is a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.
PADME (Cont’d) We are your humble servants... our fate is in your hands.
Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL. Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally

the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.
BOSS NASS Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis. Maybe wesa bein friends.
INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM – DAY
NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.
NUTE ... we’ve sent out patrols. We’ve already located their starship in the swamp... It won’t be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS This is an unexpected move for her. It’s too aggressive.. Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS Be patient... Let them make the first move. EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS – DAY
A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple head, searching the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue. GUNGAN LOOKOUT Daza comen!
ANAKIN All right. They’re here!
ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR. BOSS NASS Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together. JAR JAR Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR General??! Oh, no..
JAR JAR’s eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints. FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO GUARDS and PILOT pile out and join the group. PADME What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA Almost everyone’s in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the leaders as I could. The Federation Army’s also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost

and confused.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.
PADME (Cont’d) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA The difficulty’s getting into the throne room. Once we’re inside, we shouldn’t have a problem.
QUI-GON There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be killed.
BOSS NASS Wesa ready to do are-sa part.
JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with interest, as does ARTOO.
PADME We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON A well-conceived plan. However, there’s great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN And there’s an even bigger danger. If the Viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.
INT. THEED – PALACE – THRONE ROOM – DAY
NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through the throne room.
DARTH SIDIOUS ... she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps. DARTH MAUL I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that covenant... This will work to our advantage...
NUTE I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS Proceed. Wipe them put... all of them.
INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE – DAY (FX)
All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of

bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit the lake. When JAR JAR’s KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off. SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills. HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in long lines toward the horizon. Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line. JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators. GENERAL CEEL Energize the shields.
A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled WARRIORS.
EXT. THEED – CENTRAL PLAZA – DAY
PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans over to ANAKIN.
QUI-GON Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.
ANAKIN Sure.
QUI-GON And stay there!
DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza, SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at the BATTLE DROIDS. As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage the DROIDS outside.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME’s TROOPS rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for cover. ANAKIN runs under a

Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.
INT. THEED – PALACE THRONE ROOM – DAY
NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view screen.
NUTE I thought the battle was going to take place far from here... this is too close!
RUNE What is going on?
DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.
DARTH MAUL I told you there was more to this... the Jedi are involved.
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY (FX)
The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS. The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position. The GUNGANS get ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS. The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the protective shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump large balls of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to short out. The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS right and left. The QUEEN’S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.
PADME Get to your ships!
The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter right above where ANAKIN is hiding.
FIGHTER PILOT Better find a new hiding place, kid. I’m taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the second fighter to hide.
EXT. THEED – CENTRAL PLAZA – DAY (FX)
Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at them, hitting one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and EXPLODE.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwhelm the few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
She looks to QUI-GON.
QUI-GON I agree.
They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the cockpit.
ANAKIN Hey! Wait for me.
QUI-GON No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are. ANAKIN But, I...
QUI-GON Stay in that cockpit.
They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) We’ll’ handle this...
The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords. DARTH MAUL takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword light up. At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN’s attention to the DROIDS. The JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.
ANAKIN Oh, no...
The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) We gotta do something, Artoo.
ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship’s systems go on, and the ship begins to levitate.

ANAKIN (Cont’d) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I’ll take over. Let’s see...
ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship begins to shake.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Where’s the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one...
ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer. ANAKIN (Cont’d) Yeah, all right. “Droid blaster.” Yeah!
The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a palace hallway. The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around him.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Oops... shield up! Always on the right... shields always on the right.
ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites. ANAKIN (Cont’d) I know we’re moving. I’ll shut the energy drive down.
The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear life.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Oops!! Wrong one.
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’m not doing anything!
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I know... I didn’t push anything.
The SITH LORD’s moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once, flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT – SPACE
The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station.
RIC OLIE Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on the transmitter.
BRAVO TWO Roger, Bravo Leader.
The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the hangers and attack.
RIC OLIE Enemy fighters straight ahead!
EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS – DAY
JAR JAR’s clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up

in the wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID’s gun firing randomly, accidentally blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process. OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle. They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT – SPACE
A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN’s fighter flies into space above Naboo. ARTOO beeps a worried concern.
ANAKIN The Autopilot is searching for what other ships? ARTOO beeps and whistles.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) There is no manual override, Artoo. You’ll have to rewire it or something.
ARTOO chirps that he’s trying.
ANAKIN (cont’d) Look! There they are! That’s where the autopilot is taking us.
ANAKIN’s fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and into the power generator area next door.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR PIT – DAY
Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordmanship. The JEDI and the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed power generator. DARTH MAUL jumps onto the bridge above them. The JEDI follow, one in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their sword fight.
INT. THEED – PALACE – HALLWAY – DAY
PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped in a hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.
PADME We don’t have time for this, Captain.
CAPT. PANAKA Let’s try the outside stairway.
CAPTAIN PANAKA blasts a hole in the window, and they make their way outside the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall. SABE, EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the BATTLE DROIDS.
EXT. THEED – PALACE – OVER WATERFALL – DAY
PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO

SOLDIERS are lined up along the edge. They have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and fire at a ledge about four stories above them. Thin cables shoot out of the pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the OTHERS begin to climb up the wall.
EXT . NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY
The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR tries to run from the BATTLE DROIDS.
GENERAL CEEL Retreat! Retreat!
The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons. JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren’t so lucky. They get blasted by the energy balls. The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR’s bumbling destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT -SPACE
ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship explodes behind him (over his left shoulder).
ANAKIN Whoo, boy! This is tense!
He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on. ANAKN (Cont’d) Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!
ARTOO screams a reply.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’ve got control?
ANAKIN flips switches.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Okay, let’s go left!
He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left. ANAKIN (Cont’d) Yes... I’ve got control. You did it, Artoo!
ARTOO beeps
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that’s what I’m gonna do. Now c’mon!
An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship. ANAKIN (Cont’d) Oops! Whoa!
Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneuvers. ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’ll try spinning, that’s a good trick.
ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I know we’re in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this mess is the way we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Which one? This one?
ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT – SPACE
The SQUADRON attacks the space station.
RIC OLIE Bravo flight... go for the central bridge.
BRAVO TWO Roger, Bravo Leader.
The attack is fruitless.
RIC OLIE Their deflector shield is too strong. We’ll never get through it.
Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks.
ANAKIN I know, Artoo! This isn’t Podracing!
The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN’s fighter, sending it into a spin. ARTOO screams.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) We’re hit!
ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger. ANAKIN (Cont’d) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!
ANAKIN’s ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’m trying to stop! I’m trying to stop! Whoa!
ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the hanger deck. ARTOO gives out a worried whistle.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) All right! All right! Get the system started!
ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Everything’s overheated. All the lights are red. ARTOO sees DROIDS approaching, and beeps frantically.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR PIT – DAY
The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs to catch up.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM – HALLWAY
The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled

with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from DARTH MAUL. The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor. OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open. QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.
INT. THEED – PALACE – HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne room. Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping them in the middle. PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME Throw down your weapons. They win this round. CAPT. PANAKA But we can’t...
PADME Captain, I said throw down your weapons.
CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons. EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY
A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart. OOM-9 sees the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals a retreat as the tanks enter the battle. The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off. JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are everywhere. It is chaos.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM – HALLWAY
The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI- GON and the DARK LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole. The electron ray gates begin to

close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron field. QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated OBI-WAN watches. DARTH MAUL catches QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON’s chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON slumps to the floor in a heap.
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY
The GUNGANS have been overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS.
JAR JAR Dissa bad, berry bombad.
GENERAL CEEL Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.
INT. THED – PALACE THRONE ROOM – DAY
PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.
NUTE Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty... and end this pointless debate in the Senate. SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS. Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.
SABE I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you’ve lost! NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the TEN GUARDS in the room.
NUTE After her! This one is a decoy!
SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to PADME.
NUTE (Cont’d) Your Queen will not get away with this.
PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA. PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS. The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and afraid. PADME Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.

NUTE Don’t be absurd. There are too few of you. It won’t be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR – MELTING PIT
OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI. OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary. DARTH MAUL catches OBI- WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN’s lightsaber down the endless shaft. The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment, OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON’s lightsaber to hi, throwing DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death. OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.
OBI-WAN Master! Master!
QUI-GON It is too late... It’s...
OBI-WAN No!
QUI-GON Obi-Wan promise... promise me you’ll train the boy... OBI-WAN Yes, Master...
QUI-GON He is the chosen one... he will... bring balance... train him! QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT – FEDERATION HANGER
ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding the ship. He ducks back down.
ANAKIN Uh oh. This is not good.
He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.
The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN Where’s your pilot?
ARTOO beeps a reply.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN (Cont’d) You’re the pilot?
ARTOO whistles.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN (Cont’d) Let me see your identification! ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.
ANAKIN Yes... we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we’ll blast you!
ANAKIN Not if I can help it! Shields up!
ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by ANAKIN’s shields. ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) This should stop them.
ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) ... and take this!
He presses a button and launches two torpedoes which miss the DROIDS.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Darn... I missed!
The two torpedoes fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Let’s get out of here!
ANAKIN’s ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.
TEY HOW Sir, we’re losing power... There is some problem with the main reactor...
DOFINE Impossible!! I don’t...
The bridge explodes.
INT. NABOO FIGHTER – COCKPIT – SPACE
RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship starts to explode from the inside out.
BRAVO TWO What’s that?? It’s blowing up from the inside.
RIC OLIE I don’t know, we didn’t hit it.
BRAVO THREE Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY
Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over.
JAR JAR Wierdind...
EXT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
ANAKIN and ARTOO follow the squad of yellow Naboo starfighters into the main hanger.

INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
RIC OLIE and the OTHER PILOTS gather around as they exit their ships.
BRAVO TWO He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted the main reactor...
BRAVO THREE Amazing... They don’t teach that in the academy. ANAKIN’s ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship.
RIC OLIE We’re all accounted for. Who flew that ship?
ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in amazement.
ANAKIN I’m not going to get into trouble, am I?
ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.
INT. MAIN HANGER – COURTYARD – DAY
The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and RUNE HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the NEIMOIDIANS. PADME Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this.
CAPT. PANAKA I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye. The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI MASTERS. The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.
AMIDALA Congratulations on your election, Chancellor. It is so good to see you again.
PALPATINE It’s good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic. OBI-WAN greets YODA and the OTHER JEDI as CAPTAIN PANAKA takes the NEIMODIANS onto the cruiser.
INT. TURRET ROOM – NABOO PALACE – LATE DAY
The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of the room.
YODA Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Council does. But

agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not. OBI-WAN Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
OBI-WAN Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must.
YODA Qui-Gon’s defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be. EXT. THEED – CENTRAL PLAZA – FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS – SUNSET
QUI-GON’s body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the QUEEN, SIO BIBBLE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NABOO TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN He is one with the Force, Anakin... You must let go. ANAKIN What will happen to me now?
OBI-WAN I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise. To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.
MACE WINDU There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith. YODA Always two there are... no more... no less. A master and an apprentice.
MACE WINDU But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?
They give each other a concerned look.
EXT. THEED – CENTRAL PLAZA – DAY
CHILDEREN SING and throw flowers on the passing GUNGAN SOLDIERS. The CROWDS CHEER. It is a grand parade. QUEEN AMIDALA stands next to the SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, SIO BIBBLE, and the JEDI COUNCIL. ARTOO stands in front of the QUEEN’S HANDMAIDENS and whistles at the parade. QUEEN AMIDALA and PALPATINE smile at one another. In the parade are BOSS NASS and his GUARDS, JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL. The GUNGANS ride KAADU. They stop before the QUEEN and walk up the steps to stand by her side. BOSS NASS holds up the Globe of Peace. EVERYONE CHEERS. The parade marches on.

End titles


Title: Attack of the clones
A vast sea of stars serves as a backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.
There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several hundred solar systems under the leadership of the rebel leader, Count Dooku, have declared their intentions to secede from the Republic.
This separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy.
Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to Coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi.
PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.
2 EXT. CORUSCANT – DAWN 2
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.
3 EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDINGPLATFORM – DAWN 3
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship LANDS on the central leaf, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining platform.
A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group is a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORMÉ, Senator Amidala’s handmaiden.
One of the FIGRTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship, and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA’S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all.
The ramp lowers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSÉ), and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.
The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.
Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO
 
ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. Two FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADMÉ AMIDALA.
3 CONTINUED:
PADMÉ
Cordé...
She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé’s eyes open. She looks up at her.
CORDÉ
... I’m sorry, M’Lady... I’m... not sure I...
CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.
PADMÉ
No... No... No...!
TYPHO
M’Lady... You are still in danger.
PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around atthe devastation. There are tears in her eyes.
PADMÉ
I should not have come back.
TYPHO
This vote is very important. You did your duty and CORDÉ did hers. Now come.
(She doesn’t respond)
M’Lady please!
She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.
4 EXT. SENATE BUILDING – DAY 4
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.
5 INT. SENATE CHAMBER – DAY 5
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor’s majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.
MAS AMEDDA
Order! We shall have order! The motion for the republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.
PALPATINE
... My esteemed colleagues, excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... has been assassinated!
5 CONTINUED:
There is a shock silence in the vast arena.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
This grevious blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honorable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend.
There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the center of the arena.
ASK AAK
How many More Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and we need an army to do it.
A second pad moves into the center of the area with DARSANA, the AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.
DARSANA
Why weren’t the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe under their protection.
SENATOR ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.
ORN FREE TAA
The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war. PALPATINE
Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war. The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADMÉ AMIDALA with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR and DORMÉ, maneuvers her pod into the center of the vast arena.
PADMÉ
My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all

costs, we do not want war!
The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and applause.
5 CONTINUED: (2) 5
PALPATINE
It is with with great surprise and joy the chair recognizes the Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
PADMÉ
Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure its passage...
Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA. PADMÉ
(continuing)
I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again. There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If we offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannotbelieve they do.
There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDWA.
ORN MEE TAA
My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law.
AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.
5 CONTINUED: (3) 5
PALPATINE
Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands
 
adjourned.
6 EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING – DAY 6
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.
7 INT. CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE – DAY 7
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED- CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLO KI- ADI MUNDI,
and MACE WINDU sit across from him.
PALPATINE
I don’t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
MACE WINDU
If they do break away -
PALPATINE
No! I will not let that happen!
MACE WINDU
But if they do, you must realize there aren’t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
PALPATINE
Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
YODA closes his eyes.
YODA
Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
PALPATINE
What?
MACE WINDU
What do you sense, Master?
YODA
Impossible to see... The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of -
(opens his eyes)
Do their duty the Jedi will.
A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears
on the Chancellor’s desk.
7 CONTINUED: 7
DAR WAC
The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord.
PALPATINE

Send them in.
They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORMÉ, and THREE SENATORS (BAIL ORGANA, LUMINARA UNDULI, and HOROX RYYDER) enter the office. As YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.
YODA
With you, the Force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.
PADMÉ
Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
MACE WINDU
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
PADMÉ
I don’t wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it. There is a stir of surprise. They look at one another.
MACE WINDU
You know, M’Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn’t assassinate anyone, it’s not in his character.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
PALPATINE
Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end? PADMÉ
I don’t know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it... YODA
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
PALPATINE
Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
BAIL ORGANA
Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?

PADMÉ
Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...
PALPATINE
...”situation is that serious.” No, but I do, Senator.
PADMÉ
Chancellor, please! I don’t want any more guards!
PALPATINE
I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with...an old friend like... Master Kenobi...
PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.
MACE WINDU
That’s possible. He has just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.
PALPATINE
You must remember him, M’Lady... hewatched over you during the blockade conflict.
PADMÉ
This is not necessary, Chancellor.
PALPATINE
Do it for me, M’Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.
AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.
MACE WINDU
I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M’Lady.
YODA leans into her ear.
YODA
Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help.
7 CONTINUED: (3) 7
As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.
PALPATINE
I will not let this Republic, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two.
8 EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS – TWILIGHT 8
A graceful skyskraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.
9 INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR –
EVENING 9
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the

corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognizes OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.
JAR JAR
Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa soo smilen to see’en yousa. Wahooooo! OBI-WAN smiles.
OBI-WAN
It’s good to see you, too, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR
Oops! Weresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodialect... speak it like a native now. Don’t really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it...
JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN’S APPRENTICE.
JAR JAR
(continuing)
...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Noooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
(Looks at Anakin)
Noooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen! ANAKIN
Hi, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.
JAR JAR
Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
10 INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT – EVENING 10
PADMÉ is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORMÉ. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.
JAR JAR
Lookie... lookie... Oops! Oh, dear, I’m afraid I’ve forgotten myself again.
PADMÉ and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADMÉ. She glances at him.
OBI-WAN
It’s a pleasure to see you again, M’Lady.
PADMÉ walks over to OBI-WAN and takes his hand in hers.
PADMÉ
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi. I’m so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here

is unnecessary.
OBI-WAN
I’m sure the Jedi Council has their reasons.
She moves in front of ANAKIN.
PADMÉ
Annie??
(stares)
My goodness, you’ve grown.
They look at each other for a long moment.
ANAKIN
(trying to be smooth)
So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADMÉ laughs and shakes her head.
PADMÉ
Oh, Annie, you’ll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.
OBI-WAN
Our presence will be invisible, M’Lady.
TYPHO
I’m very grateful you here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
10 CONTINUED 10
PADMÉ
I don’t need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
OBI-WAN
(frowning)
We’re here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation. ANAKIN
We will find out who’s trying to kill you, Padmé, I promise you!
He’s done it again. he bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.
OBI-WAN
We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner!
ANAKIN
I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course!

OBI-WAN
We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.
ANAKIN
Why?
OBI-WAN
What??!!
ANAKIN
Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It’s overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
OBI-WAN
We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
PADMÉ
Perhaps with merely your presence the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire. Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORMÉ leave the room.
TYPHO
Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here.
(more)
10 CONTINUED: (2) 10
TYPHO
(cont’d)
I’ll have an officer on every floor and I’ll be at the command center downstairs.
JAR JAR
Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times.
CAPTAIN TYPHO leaves.
ANAKIN
She didn’t even recognize me, Jar Jar. I’ve thought about her every day since we parted... and she’s forgotten me completely.
JAR JAR
Shesa happy. Happer den mesa see-en her in longo time.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, you’re focusing on the negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now let’s check the security here. ANAKIN

Yes, my Master.
11 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE – EVENING 11
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted against the traffic-filled sky.
12 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR – EVENING 12
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallway, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.
MACE WINDU
Why couldn’t we see this attack on the Senator?
YODA
Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
MACE WINDU
The prophecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
YODA
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilites of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
*GREEN REVISIONS 7/5/00
12 CONTINUED: 12
MACE WINDU
It’s been then years, and the Sith still have not shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
YODA
... Out there, they are. A certainty, that is.
MACE WINDU
Do you think Obi-Wan’s apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
YODA
Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are
heard.
13 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHT 13
PADMÉ is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.
14 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM – NIGHT 14
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the

apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN’S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back on his belt.
The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters. OBI-WAN
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?
ANAKIN
Quiet as a tomb. I don’t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADMÉ on the bed.
OBI-WAN
What’s going on?
ANAKIN shrugs.
ANAKIN
She covered the camera. I don’t think she liked me watching her. *GREEN REVISIONS 7/5/00
14 CONTINUED: 14 OBI-WAN
What is she thinking? ANAKIN
She programmed Artoo to warn us if there’s an intruder.
OBI-WAN
It’s not an intruder I’m worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.
ANAKIN
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don’t we, Master? OBI-WAN
You’re using her as bait??
ANAKIN
It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
OBI-WAN
It’s too risky... and your senses aren’t that attuned, young apprentice. ANAKIN
And yours are?
OBI-WAN
Possibly.

15 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHT 15
As PADMÉ sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.
ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADMÉ.
16 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM – NIGHT 16
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.
OBI-WAN
You look tired.
*GREEN REVISIONS 7/5/00
16 CONTINUED: 16
ANAKIN
I don’t sleep well, anymore.
OBI-WAN
Because of your mother?
ANAKIN
I don’t know why I keep dreaming about her now. I haven’t seen her since I was little.
OBI-WAN
Dreams pass in time.
ANAKIN
I’d rather dream of Padmé. Just being around her again is... intoxicating.
OBI-WAN
Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You’ve made a commitment to the Jedi Order... a commitment not easily broken... and don’t forget she’s a politician. They’re not to be trusted. ANAKIN
She’s not like the others in the Senate, Master.
OBI-WAN
It’s been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing

those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
ANAKIN
Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics... and besides, you’re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt.
OBI-WAN
Palpatine’s a politician, I’ve observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
ANAKIN
I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about... ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN.
16 CONTINUED: (2) 16
OBI-WAN
I sense it too.
17 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM – NIGHT 17
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADMÉ’S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADMÉ wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.
OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and races straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window,
18 EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING – NIGHT 18 OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.
19 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT 19 ANAKIN and PADMÉ stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.
ANAKIN
Stay here!
CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORMÉ, enter the room as ANAKIN dashes out.

20 EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT – NIGHT 20
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realizes the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROIDI’S systems light up again, and it takes off.
21 EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS – ENTRANCE – NIGHT 21 ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into a open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.
22 EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT – NIGHT 22
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takes the JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
22 CONTINUED: 22
as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, then run across the roof, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy Bounty Hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI, EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-VAN.
OBI-WAN
I have a bad feeling about this.
FINALLY the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.
ANAKIN
That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
OBI-WAN
What took you so long?
ANAKIN
Oh, you know, Master, I couldn’t find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM as she fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.
OBI-WAN
If you’d spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
ANAKIN
I thought I already did.
OBI-WAN
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!
As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAN WESELL continues firing at them.
ANAKIN
Sorry, I forgot you don’t like flying, Master.
OBI-WAN
I don’t mind flying... but what you’re doing is suicide.
They barely miss a commuter train.
22 CONTINUED: (2) 22
ANAKIN
Master, you know I’ve been flying since before I could walk, I’m very good at this.
OBI-WAN
Just slow down!
ZAM WESELL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel. OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Wait! Don’t go in there!
ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
You know I don’t like it when you do that!
ANAKIN
Sorry, Master. Don’t worry, this guy’s gonna kill himself any minute now!

ZAN WESELL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN
What are you doing? He’s gonna blast me.
ANAKIN
Right – this isn’t working.
ANAKIN slides underneath Zam’s speeder. They race along in
traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops. OBI-WAN
That was too close!
ANAKIN
Clear that!
OBI-WAN
What??
22 CONTINUED: (3) 22
ANAKIN
Clear the flag! We’re losing power! Hurry!
OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out on the front engine and pulls the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.
OBZ-WAN
Whooooaaa! Don’t do that! I don’t like it when you do that!
ANAKIN
So sorry, Master.
They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery. OBI-WAN
It’s dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don’t go through there!
Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Yiiii, what are you doing?
ANAKIN
Sorry, Master!
OBI-WAN
(sarcastically)
Oh, that was good...
ANAKIN
That was crazy!!!
ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point- blank as ANAKIN approaches.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Ahh, damn.
OBI-WAN
Stop!!
ANAKIN
No, we can make it.
ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER’S speeder as he dives under it and through a small gap in the building hitting severa1 pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain
control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping
a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN
to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.
OBI-WAN
I’m crazy... 1I’m crazy... I’m crazy.
22 CONTINUED: (4) 22
ANAKIN
But it worked... we made it.
OBI-WAN
(angrily)
It didn’t work... we’ve stalled! And you almost got us killed!
ANAKIN
I think we’re still alive.
ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It races to life.
OBI-WAN
(very angrily)
It was stupid!
ANAKIN.

(sheepishly)
I could have made it...
OBI-WAN
(furious)
But you didn’t!!! And now we’ve lost him.
Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts are everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up and see ZAM WESELL take off.
ANAKIN
No we didn’t...
Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out a small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right.
OBI-VAN
Where are you going?! ... He went down there, the other way. ANAKIN
This is a shortcut... I think.
OBI-WAN
What do you mean, “You think?” What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You’ve lost him!
ANAKIN
Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep’s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I’d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he’s working for...
OBI-WAN
(sarcastic)
Oh, so that’s why we’re going in the wrong direction.
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
22 CONTINUED: (5) 22
ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooms up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Well, you lost him.
ANAKIN
I’m deeply sorry, Master.
ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
Excuse me for a moment.
ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam’s speeder about five stories below then cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realizes what has happened.
ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder’s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN’s hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can’t reach him, then he scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.
OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver’s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger’s seat.
ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM’s hand. She grabs the Jedi’s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder.
Just as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.
23 EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET – NIGHT 23
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up of the pavement and runs after her down the very crowded street.
It’s the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected in filthy puddles. It’s pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
23 CONTINUED: 23
ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, then sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.
Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.
A nightclub sign is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN’S lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
Anakin!
ANAKIN
She went into that club, Master.
OBI-WAN
Patience.
OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Here. Next time try not to lose it.
ANAKIN
Sorry, Master.
ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back. OBI-WAN
A Jedi’s saber is his most precious possession...
ANAKIN
Yes Master.
He reaches for the lightsaber. OBI-WAN pulls it back.
OBI-WAN
He must keep it with him at all times
ANAKIN
I know, Master.
OBI-WAN
This weapon is your life.
ANAKIN
I’ve heard this lesson before...
OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it. OBI-WAN

But, you haven’t learned anything, Anakin. ANAKIN
I try Master.
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
24 INT. NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT 24
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them.
OBI-WAN
Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!
ANAKIN
Don’t say that Master... You’re the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don’t want to cause you pain.
OBI-WAN
Then why don’t you listen to me?!
ANAKIN
I will. I’ll do better, I promise.
OBI-WAN
Do you see him?
ANAKIN
I think he’s a she...
OBI-WAN
Then be extra careful...
(nods to the room)
Check it out.
OBT-WAN goes away.
ANAKIN
Where are you going, Master?
OBI-WAN
To get a drink.
OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.
CLOSE – Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in front of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.
ELIAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
Wanna buy some death sticks?
OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.
OBI-WAN

You don’t want to sell me deathsticks. ELIAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
I don’t want to sell you deathsticks. OBI-WAN moves his fingers.
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/06
24 CONTINUED: 24
OBI-WAN
You want to go home and re-think your life. ELIAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
I want to go home and re-think my life.
He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.
CLOSE – The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.
ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.
The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM’S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.
The room is silent. ALIEWS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN’s side, his lightsaber glowing. ANAKIN
Easy... official business. Go back to your drinks.
Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PEFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.
25 EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT 25
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAN into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.
OBI-WAN
Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
ZAM WESELL
The Senator from Naboo.
OBI-WAN
Who hired you?
ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.
ZAM WESELL
It was just a job.
ANAKIN

Tell us!
ZAM WSELL
That Senator’s gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won’t make the same mistake I did...
25 CONTINUED: 25
OBI-WAN
This wound’s going to need treatment.
ANAKIN
Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!
ZAM glares hatefully.
ZAM WESELL
It was a bounty hunter called...
There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.
There is a WHOOSH from above. OBI-1WAN and ANAKIN look up to see an ARMORED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. He shoots up fast into the sky and disappears. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.
OBI-WAN
Toxic dart...
26 INT. SENATE, BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT – DAY 26 ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADMÉ’s bedroom. PADMÉ and DORMÉ move about packing luggage.
PADMÉ
Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.
JAR JAR
Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
PADMÉ
What??!!
JAR JAR
(coughs, recovers)
Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honored to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride.
(pompously)
It is not every day that I am called upon to...
PADMÉ kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.
 
PADMÉ
You are a good friend, Jar Jar. I don’t wish to hold you up. I’m sure you have a great deal to do.
JAR JAR
Of course, M’Lady.
*BLUE REVISIONS 7/3/00
26 CONTINUED: 26
JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADMÉ is in a very bad mood.
PADMÉ
I do not like this idea of hiding.
ANAKIN
Don’t worry, now that the council has ordered an investigation, it won’t take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
PADMÉ
(frustrated)
I haven’t worked for a year to defeat the “military creation act” not to be here when its fate is decided!
ANAKIN
Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
PADMÉ
Pride?!? Annie, you’re young, and you don’t have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time. ANAKIN
Sorry, M’Lady. I was only trying to...
FADMÉ
Annie! No!
ANAKIN
Please don’t call me that.
PADMÉ
What?
ANAKIN
Annie...
PADMÉ
I’ve always called you that... it is your name, isn’t it?
ANAKIN
It’s Anakin. When you say Annie it’s like I’m still a little boy... and I’m not.
PADMÉ

I’m sorry, Anakin. It’s impossible to deny you’ve... (looks him over)
...that you’ve grown up.
PADMÉ smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy. 26 CONTINUED: (2) 26
ANAKIN
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
PADMÉ
Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It’s the only way we grow.
ANAKIN
Don’t get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor, as wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I’m a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I’m ahead of him. I’m ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He feels I’m too unpredictable... other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won’t let me move on.
PADMÉ
That must be frustrating.
ANAKIN
It’s worse... he’s overly critical! He never listens! He just doesn’t understand. It’s not fair!
PADMÉ cannot suppress a laugh. She shakes her head.
PADMÉ
I’m sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when be didn’t get his way.
ANAKIN
I’m not whining! I’m not.
PADMÉ just smiles at him. DORMÉ laughs in the background. PADMÉ
I didn’t say it to hurt you.
ANAKIN
I know...
There is a brief silence, then PADMÉ comes over to ANAKIN. PADMÉ
Anakin...
They look into each other’s eyes for the first time.
PADMÉ
(continuing)

Don’t try to grow up too fast.
26 CONTINUED: (3) 26
ANAKIN
I am grown up. You said it yourself. ANAKIN looks deep into PADME’s eyes. PADMÉ
Please don’t look at me like that. ANAKIN
Why not?
PADMÉ
Because I can see what you’re thinking. ANAKIN
(laughing)
Ahh... So, you have Jedi powers too? DORMÉ is watching with concern. PADMÉ
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
ANAKIN
Sorry, M’Lady.
ANAKIN backs away as PADMÉ turns and goes back to her packing. 27 EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS – DAY 27
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant’s industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes move supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of the starships. The bus stops before a huge, intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.
27 EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS – DAY 28
ANAKIN and PADMÉ, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORMÉ, and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORMÉ is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
Be safe, M’Lady.
PADMÉ
Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dormé... The threat’s on you two now.
DORMÉ

He’ll be safe with me.
They laugh, and PADMÉ embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORMÉ starts to weep.
28 CONTINUED: 28
PADMÉ
You’ll be fine.
DORMÉ
It’s not me, M’Lady. I worry about you. What if they realize I’m not you?
PADMÉ
(looks to Anakin)
Then my Jedi protector will have to prove bow grown up he is. DORMÉ and PADMÉ smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Don’t attract attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
ANAKIN
Yes, Master.
OBI-WAN
(to Padmé)
I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M’Lady. You’ll be back here in no time.
PADMÉ
I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
ANAKIN
Time to go.
PADMÉ
I know.
PADMÉ gives DORMÉ a last hug, ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ART00 is waiting for them.
OBI-WAN
May The Force Be With You.
ANAKIN
May The Force Be With You, Master.
They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.
PADMÉ
Suddenly, I’m afraid...
ANAKIN

This is my first assignment on my own, I’m kinda scared too. PADMÉ
There’s nothing to worry about we have Artoo with us.
They 1augh.
28 CONTINUED: (2) 28
OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADMÉ disappear into the vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.
OBI-WAN
I hope he doesn’t try anything foolish.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
I’d be more concerned about her doing something, than him.
29 EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS – CORUSCANT – DAY 29
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.
30 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY – LATE DAY 30
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI- WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heading for the Analysis Rooms.
31 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES – LATE DAY 31 OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK- 4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console. PK-4
Place the subject for analysis on the sensor tray, please.
091-WAS puts the dart onto the tray, which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in front of OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN
It’s a toxic dart, I need to know where it came from and who made it PK-4
One moment, please.
Diagrams and data appear on the screen, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. The tray slides out.
PK-4
(continuing)
As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Markings cannot be identified. Probably self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society.

OBI-WAN
Excuse me? Could you try again please?
31 CONTINUED: 31
PK-4
Master Jedi, our records are very thorough. They cover eighty percent of the galaxy. If I can’t tell you where it came from, nobody can.
OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID. OBI-WAN
Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out, but I think I know someone who might.
32 EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER 32
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.
33 INT. STARFREIGHTER, STEERAGE HOLD – DAY 33
A great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.
SERVER
Keep moving! Keep moving!
ARTOO slips a tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like bread. A SERVER sees him.
SERVER
(continuing)
Hey! No Droids!
ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless,
ANAKIN
No, no, Mom, no...
He is sweating. PADMÉ leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes with a start, then realizes where he is. PADMÉ simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.
ANAKIN
(continuing)

What?
PADMÉ
You seemed to be having a nightmare.
ANAKIN looks at PADMÉ a little more closely, trying to see if he revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.
33 CONTINUED: 33
PADMÉ
(continuing)
Are you hungry?
ANAKIN
Thanks.
PADMÉ
We went into lightspeed a while ago.
ANAKIN looks into PADMÉ’s eyes.
ANAKIN
I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I’ve thought about it every day since I left. It’s by far the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen... PADMÉ is a little unnerved by his intense stare.
PADMÉ
You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
ANAKIN
I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
PADMÉ
It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
ANAKIN
Or be with the people I love.
PADMÉ
Are you allowed to love? I thought it was forbidden for a Jedi. ANAKIN
Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi’s life, so you might say we’re encouraged to love.
PADMÉ
You have changed so much.
33 CONTINUED: (2) 33
ANAKIN

You haven’t changed a bit. You’re exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
PADMÉ
It hasn’t...
ANAKIN
I can’t wait to breathe that sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualize the Force, those hills are what I see. ANAKIN looks at PADMÉ when he says this.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I love Naboo...
There is an awkward moment.
PADMÉ
(changing the subject)
You were dreaming about your mother earlier, weren’t you?
ANAKIN
Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don’t want to lose it. Recently I’ve been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.
PADMÉ gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.
34 EXT. CORDSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET – MORNING
34
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs thundering past. Above, the old elevated monospeed with occasional “shiny freighters” hissing through.
OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windows it says “DEX’S DINER,” in alien lettering. He goes inside.
35 INT. CORUSCANT, DEX’S DINER – MORNING 35
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating – TOUGH- LOOKING WORKES, FREIGHTER DRIVERS ETC. HERNIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.
HERMIONE BAGWA
Can I help ya?
OBI-WAN
I’m looking for Dexter.
35 CONTINUED: 35
HERMIONE’s eyes narrow.

HERMIONE BAGWA
Waddya want him for?
OBI-WAN
He’s not in trouble. It’s personal.
HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause, then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.
HERMIONE BAGWA
Someone to see ya, honey.
(lowering her voice)
A Jedi, by the looks of him.
Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.
DEXTER JETTSTER
Obi-Wan!
OBI-WAN
Hey, Dex.
DEXTER JETTSTER
Take a seat! Be right with ya!
OBI-WAN sits in a booth.
HERMIONE BAGWA
You want a cup of ardees?
OBI-WAN
Thank you.
HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER a1ppears. He is big – bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely. DEXTER JETTSTER
Hey, ol’ buddy!
OBI-WAN
Hey, Dex.
DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in front of them.
DEXTER JETTSTER
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?
OBI-WAN
You can tell me what this is.
OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX’s eyes widen. He puts down his mug.
DEXTER JETTSTER

(softly)
Well, waddya know...
35 CONTINUED: (2) 35
DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.
DEXTER JETTSTER
(continuing)
I ain’t seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the outer rim!
OBI-WAN
Do you know where it came from?
DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.
DEXTER JETTSTER
This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here, is a Kamino Kyberdart.
OBI-WAN
Kamino Kyberdart?.. I wonder why it didn’t show up in our analysis archive.
DEXTER JETTSTER
It’s these funny little cuts on the side that give it away... Those analysis droids you’ve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between know1edge and wisdom.
OBI-WAN
Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn’t be here, would we? (laughing)
Kamino... doesn’t sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
DEXTER JETTSTER
No, it’s beyond the outer rim. I’d say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. These Kaminoians keep to themselves. They’re cloners. Damned good ones, too.
OBI-WAN picks up the dart, holding it midway between them. OBI-WAN
Cloners? Are they friendly?
DEXTER JETTSTER
It depends.
OBI-WAN
On what, Dex?
DEXTER grins.

35 CONTINUED: (3) 35
DEXTER JETTSTER
On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is... 36 EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT – DAY 36
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.
PADMÉ, ANAKIN, and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.
37 EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD -AFTERNOON 37 The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADMÉ, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches before them, and they see the rose-colored domes of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.
ANAKIN
If I grew up here, I don’t think I’d ever leave.
PADMÉ
(laughing)
I doubt that.
ANAKIN
No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... the problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse it felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace – the way it shimmers in the sunlight – the way the air always smells of flowers...
PADMÉ
...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw I the Capital, I was very young... I’d never seen a waterfall before. I thought they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I’d live in the palace.
ANAKIN
Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
PADMÉ
(laughing)
No. That was the last thing I thought of.
(more)
37 CONTINUED: 37
PADMÉ(cont’d)

My dream was to help in the “Refugee Relief Movement.” I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realized how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the “Apprentice Legislators,” then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn’t the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I’m not sure I was old enough. I’m not sure I was ready.
ANAKIN
The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
PADMÉ
Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried about me during the blockade and couldn’t wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn’t refuse her.
ANAKIN
I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I’m glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
PADMÉ
I think so too.
ANAKIN and PADMÉ walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.
38 INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM – AFTERNOON 38 QUEEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE 0F ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.
38 CONTINUED: 38
QUEEN JAMILLIA
We’ve been worried about you.
(takes her hand)
I’m so glad you’re safe, Padmé.
PADMÉ
Thank you, Your Highness. I only wish I could have served you better

by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
SIO BIBBLE
Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists? PADMÉ
About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I’m sure it’s going to push us into a civil war.
SIO BIBBLE
It’s unthinkable. There hasn’t been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
PADMÉ
Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don’t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves, I’m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federations for help. QUEEN JAMILLIA
The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
PADMÉ
I’m afraid that, despite the Chancellor’s best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
38 CONTINUED: (2) 38
SIO BIBBLE
It’s outrageous that, after all of those hearings, and four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
QUEEN JAMILLIA
Remember, Counselor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation’s armies. That’s a move in the right direction.
PADMÉ
There are rumors, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
ANAKIN

The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
PADMÉ
Let’s pray that day never comes.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
In the meantime.. we must consider your own safety.
SIO BIBBLE signals. All the OTHER ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.
SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin)
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
PADMÉ
Anakin’s not a Jedi yet, Counselor. He’s still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...
ANAKIN
(nettled)
Hey, hold on a minute.
PADMÉ
Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
ANAKIN
Excuse me! I am in charge of security here, M’Lady.
38 CONTINUED: (3) 38
SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.
PADMÉ
Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we’re here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
ANAKIN
(takes a deep breath)
Sorry, M’Lady.
SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin, amused)
She is right. The lake country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.
QUEEN JAMILLIA

Perfect. It’s settled then.
ANAKIN glares at PADMÉ. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
(continuing)
Padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family’s very worried about you.
PADMÉ looks worried. They ALL exit down the main staircase.
39 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE – DAY 39
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.
40 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVE LIBRARY – DAY 40
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front of it, studying the striking features of the chiseled face.
On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch to infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archive material.
After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments, MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist, is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.
JOCASTA NU
Did you call for assistance?
40 CONTINUED: 40
OBI-WAN
(distracted in thought)
Yes... yes, I did...
JOCASTA NU
He has a powerful face, doesn’t he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
OBI-WAN
I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.
JOCASTA NU
(sighs)
The Lost Twenty... And Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.

OBI-MAN
What happened?
JOCASTA NU
Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. OBI-WAN
(surprised)
Really?
JOCASTA NU
Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists...
JOCASTA NU gazes at the bust.
JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.
40 CONTINUED: (2) 40
OBI-WAN
Interesting... I’m still not sure I understand.
JOCASTA NU
Well, I’m sure you didn’t call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
OBI-WAN
Yes, I’m trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn’t seem to show up on any of the archive charts.
JOCASTA NU
Kamino? It’s not a system I’m familiar with... let me see...
JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN’s shoulder, looking at the screen. JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?
OBI-WAN
(nodding)
According to my information, it should be in this quadrant

somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze.
JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.
JOCASTA NU
No coordinates? It sounds like the sort of directions you’d get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader.
OBI-WAN
All three, actually.
JOCASTA NU
Are you sure it exists?
OBI-QAN
Absolutely.
JOCASTA NU
Let me do a gravitational scan.
OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU study the star map hologram. JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you’re seeking was destroyed.
OBI-WAN
Wouldn’t that be on record?
40 CONTINUED: (3) 40
JOCASTA NU
It ought to be, unless it was very recent.
(shakes her head)
I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you’re searching for doesn’t exist.
OBI-WAN
That’s impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.
JOCASTA NU
The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of – if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!
OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back to the map.
41 EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET – AFTERNOON 41
PEOPLE are passing through the little street. OLD MEN are sunning themselves. WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADMÉ, and ART00 turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADMÉ wears a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

PADMÉ
There’s my house!
PADMÉ starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
What? Don’t say you’re shy!
ANAKIN
(untruthfully)
No, but I...
Suddenly there are shouts from two little girls, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADMÉ.
RYOO & POOJA
Aunt Padmé!! Aunt Padmé!!
PADMÉ
Ryoo!! Pooja!!
PADMÉ scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
I’m so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.
ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:
41 CONTINUED: 41
RYOO & POOJA
Artoo!!!
As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADMÉ laughs. ANAKIN and PADMÉ go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.
42 INT. PADMÉ’S PAENTS’ HOUSE, MAIN ROOM –
AFTERNOON 42
SOLA, PADMÉ’S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.
SOLA
(over her shoulder)
They’re eating over at iev Narran’s later, Mom. The just had a snack. They’ll be Fine.
SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADMÉ, and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padmé’s father) are coming-intar the room. PADMÉ
Anakin, this is my sister, So1a.
SOLA

Hello, Anakin.
ANAKIN
Hello.
SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padmé’s mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming good.
JOBAL
You’re just in time for dinner. I hope you’re hungry, Anakin.
ANAKIN
A little.
PADMÉ
He’s being polite, Mom. We’re starving.
RUWEE
(grinning)
You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son. EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.
JOBAL
(to Padmé)
Honey, it’s so good to see you safe. We were so worried.
PADMÉ gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches. RUWEE
Dear...
42 CONTINUED: 42
JOBAL
I know, I know but I bad to say it. Now it’s done.
SOLA
Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you’re the first boyfriend my sister’s ever brought home?
PADMÉ
(rolls her eyes)
Sola!! He isn’t my boyfriend! He’s a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
JOBAL
A bodyguard?! 0h, Padmé! The didn’t tell us it was that serious! PADMÉ
It’s not, Mom, I promise.
(glances at Jobal)
Anyway, Anakin’s a friend. I’ve known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?
They nod.
PADMÉ
 
(continuing)
He grew up.
JOBAL
Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven’t you had enough of that life? I certainly have.
PADMÉ
Mom, I’m not in any danger.
RUWEE
(to Anakin)
Is she?
ANAKIN
...Yes... I’m afraid she is.
PADMÉ
(quickly)
But not much.
43 EXT. PADMÉ’S PARENTS’ GADEN – AFTERNOON 43
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.
RUWEE
Sometimes I wish I’d traveled more... but I must say, I’m happy here. 43 CONTINUED: 43
ANAKIN
Padmé tells me you teach at the university?
RUWEE
(nodding)
Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.
44 INT. PADMÉ’S PARENTS’ HOUSE, MAIN ROOM – AFTERNOON 44
PADMÉ, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.
SOLA
Why haven’t you told us about him?
PADMÉ
What’s there to talk about? He’s just a boy.
SOLA
A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
PADMÉ
Sola – stop it!
SOLA
It’s obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven’t noticed?

PADMÉ
I’m not your baby sister, Sola, Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional.
(to Jobal)
Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
SOLA
(laughing)
Well, maybe you haven’t noticed the way he looks at you. I think you’re afraid to.
PADMÉ
Cut it out.
JOBAL
Sola’s just concerned... we all are.
PADMÉ
Oh, Mom, you’re impossible. What I’m doing is important.
JOBAL
You’ve done your service, Padmé. It’s time you had a life of your own. You’re missing so much.
45 EXT. PADME’S PARENTS’ GARDEN – AFTERNOON 45 ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.
RUWEE
Now tell me, son. How serious in this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
ANAKIN
There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there’ll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I’m sure he’ll find out who they are. This situation won’t last long.
RUWEE
I don’t want anything to happen to her.
ANAKIN
I don’t either.
46 INT. PADMÉ’S PARENTS’ HOUSE, PADMÉS ROOM – AFTERNOON 46
PADMÉ throws some things into a bag.
PADMÉ
Don’t worry, this won’t take long.
ANAKIN
I just want to get there before dark.
PADMÉ goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the rocm.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
You still live at home.
PADMÉ
I move around so much, I’ve never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
ANAKIN
I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mon was. ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Is this you?
The hologram shows PADMÉ at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.
46 CONTINUED: 46
PADMÉ
That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I’m holding? His name was N’a-kee-tula, which means sweetheart. He was so full of life. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet. ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADMÉ at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference? PADMÉ pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side – the beaming little girl, and the stern, unsmiling adolescent.
47 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY – DAY 47
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.
48 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA – DAY 48
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-0LDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

YODA
Don’t think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will.
(he sees Obi-Wan)
Younglings – enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. YODA
(continuing)
Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
CHILDREN
Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
OBI-WAN
I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
YODA,
What help to you, can I be?
48 CONTINUED: 48
OBI-WAN
I’m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn’t show up on the archive maps.
YODA
An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, Younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
The reader is a small shaft with a hollow at the top. The CHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades-close, the reader lights up and projects the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI- WAN walks into the display.
OBI-WAN
This is where it ought to be... but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn’t.
YODA
Most interesting. Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all of its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods. JEDI CHILD JACK
Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
CHILDREN
That’s right! Yes! That’s what happened! Someone erased it!
JEDI CHILD MAY

If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.
YODA
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the center of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
OBI-WAN
But Master Yoda, who could have erased information from the archives? That’s impossible, isn’t it?
YODA
(frowning)
Much harder to answer, that question is.
49 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM – LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDU ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADMÉ are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful
island in tbe middle of the lake.
50 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACE – LATEAFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADMÉ walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags inside.
ANAKIN and PADMÉ stop at the balustrade. PADMÉ looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her.
PADMÉ
When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. ANAKIN
I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet. PADMÉ becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.
PADMÉ
...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry as and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
ANAKIN
I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything’s soft... and smooth... He touches her arm. PADMÉ has become receptive to the way he

looks at her but is nervous.
PADMÉ
There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand – and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
ANAKIN
(looks in her eyes)
Everything here is magical.
PADMÉ
You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn’t.
50 CONTINUED: 50
ANAKIN
Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
They look into each other’s eyes. He touches her chin.
PADMÉ
I used to think if you looked too deeply into the glass, you would lose yourself.
ANAKIN
I think it’s true...
ANAKIN kisses PADMÉ. She doesn’t resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.
PADMÉ
I shouldn’t have done that.
ANAKIN
I’m sorry. When I’m around you, my mind is no longer my own. PADMÉ
It’s the situation... the stress...
He looks at her.
ANAKIN
...the view.
51 EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM – LATE AFTERNOON 51
Obi-Wan’s Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.
MACE WINDU
Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger. OBI-WAN
I’m concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.

MACE WINDU
He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he will be the one to bring balance to the Force.
OBI-WAN
But he still has much to learn. His skills have made him... well... arrogant. I realize now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training, and...
OBI-WAN hesitates.
51 CONTINUED: 51
MACE WINDU
There’s something else?
OBI-WAN
Master, we should not have been given this assignment. I’m afraid Anakin won’t be able to protect the Senator.
MACE WINDU
Why?
OBI-WAN
He has a... an emotional connection with her. It’s been there since he was a boy. Now he’s confused... distracted.
MACE WINDU
Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path. OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.
OBI-WAN
Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
MACE WINDU
Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May The Force Be With You.
The canopy closes. MACE WINDU watches as the Starfighter takes off.
52 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA’S QUARTERS – LATE
AFTERNOON 52
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.
53 EXT. NAB00 LAKE RETREAT, LODGE – LATE AFTERNOON 53 The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floating lamps gleam softly like jewels at the lodge. 54 INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM – LATE AFTERNOON 54
NANDI places dessert in front of PADMÉ. TECKLA does the same for

ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADMÉ picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again – the fruit moves. She looks up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate. PADMÉ
You did that?
ANAKIN looks up – wide-eyed innocence.
54 CONTINUED: 54
ANAKIN
What?
PADMÉ scowls at him. PADMÉ jabs at the fruit – Anakin subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her!
PADMÉ
That! Now stop it!
PADMÉ laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit – it loops.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
Anakin!!
ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.
ANAKIN
I’m not really-supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi- Wan were here, he’d be very grumpy.
ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruit into several pieces and sends one back to PADMÉ. She bites it out of the air and laughs.
55 INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE – TWILIGHT 55
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADMÉ is sitting in front of it, gazing into the flames.
She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.
ANAKIN
May I tell you something?
PADMÉ
I don’t know.
ANAKIN
Then how can I tell you?
PADMÉ
Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
ANAKIN

It doesn’t work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
PADMÉ
Anakin, don’t...
ANAKIN
From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn’t gone by when I haven’t thought of you.
(more)
55 CONTINUED: 55
ANAKIN(cont’d)
And now that I’m with you again, I’m in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you makes my stomach turn over – my mouth go dry. I feel dizzy. I can’t breathe. I’m haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
PADMÉ
...I can’t. We can’t. It’s just not possible.
ANAKIN
Anything’s possible. Padmé, please listen...
PADMÉ
You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You’re studying to become a Jedi Knight. I’m a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
ANAKIN
Then you do feel something! There’s an extraordinary connection between us. You’can’t deny that.
PADMÉ
Annie, it doesn’t make any difference. Jedi aren’t allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You’d be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me. ANAKIN
I was destined to be a Jedi. I don’t think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational, that is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can’t.

55 CONTINUED: (2) 55
PADMÉ
I am not going to give in to this. I’m not going to throw my life away. I have more imortant things to do than fall in love.
There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.
ANAKIN
It wouldn’t have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
PADMÉ
Then we’d be living a lie – one we couldn’t keep up even if we wanted to. My sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn’t do that, could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
Silence for a moment.
ANAKIN
...No, you’re right. It would destroy us.
56 EXT. SPACE 56
It’s just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan’s starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.
57 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAY 57
Heavy rains and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan’s Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.
The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the howling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.
58 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE – DAY 58
Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face. TAUN WE
Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi.
OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond-shaped eyes.
TAUN WE
(continuing)
Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.
58 CONTINUED 58
OBI-WAN

(warily)
I’m expected?
TAUN WE
Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren’t coming. Now please, this way! OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor. 59 INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE – DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.
TAUN WE
May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi...
OBI-WAN
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LAMA SU
Please...
LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra-high- tech.
LAMA SU
I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.
OBI-WAN
You make me feel most welcome.
LAMA SU
And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way.
OBI-WAN
(improvising)
That is... good news.
LAMA SU
Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?
OBI-WAN
I’m sorry Master – ?
LAMA SU
Jedi Master Sido-Dyas. He’s still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?

OBI-WAN
Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.
LAMA SU
(rising)
You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
OBI-WAN
(rising)
That’s why I’m here.
60 EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW – LATER AFTERNOON 60 PADMÉ and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS grazes contentedly.
Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADMÉ is picking flowers.
PADMÉ
I don’t know...
ANAKIN
Sure you do... you just don’t want to tell me.
PADMÉ
Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
ANAKIN
They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak- minded.
PADMÉ
All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
ANAKIN
All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
PADMÉ
I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist. ANAKIN
Maybe he was the smart one.
60 CONTINUED: 60
PADMÉ
You really don’t like politicians, do you?
ANAKIN
I like two or three, but I’m not really sure about one of them.

(smiling)
I don’t think the system works.
PADMÉ
How would you have it work?
ANAKIN
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what’s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
PADMÉ
That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don’t always agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
ANAKIN
Then they should be made to.
PADMÉ
By whom? Who’s going to make them?
ANAKIN
I don’t know. Someone.
PADMÉ
You?
ANAKIN
Of course not me.
PADMÉ
But someone.
ANAKIN
Someone wise.
PADMÉ
That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.
ANAKIN
Well, if it works...
PADMÉ stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, but can’t hold a smile.
PADMÉ
You’re making fun of me!
60 CONTINUED: (2) 60
ANAKIN
(sarcastic)
On no, I’d be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
PADMÉ
You’re so bad!

PADMÉ picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADMÉ throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them. ANAKIN
You’re always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADMÉ laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.
ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADMÉ starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.
The SHAAK crosses in front of PADMÉ. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the Shaak’s tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADMÉ laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADMÉ jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.
ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She takes it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADMÉ scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ANAKIN digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.
61 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) –
DAY 61
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.
LAMA SU
(beaming)
Magnificent, aren’t they?
OBI-WAN nods slowly.
62 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMISSARY – DAY 62 LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

62 CONTINUED: 62
LAMA SU
We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.
OBI-WAN
Who was the original host?
LAMA SU
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-picked Jango Fett himself.
OBI-WAN
Where is this bounty hunter now?
LAMA SU
Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he’s free to come and go as he pleases.
63 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS – DAY 63
The tour continues through a long corridor filled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.
LAMA SU
Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing – an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn’t it?
OBI-WAN
Unaltered?
LAMA SU
Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...
OBI-WAN
I would like to meet this Jango Fett.
TAUN WE
I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.
TAUN WE bows, and leaves.
64 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM – DAY 64 The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.
OBI-WAN
You mentioned growth acceleration...
LAMA SU
Oh yes, it’s essential.

Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-Dyas first placed the order, and they’re already mature...
OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES. OBI-WAN
And these?
LAMA SU
About five years ago.
65 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY – DAY 65 They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.
LAMA SU
They’re immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action.
OBI-WAN
Very impressive.
LAMA SU
I’d hoped you would be pleased.
OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.
OBI-WAN
(carefully)
Tell me, Prime Minister, when my Master Sido-Dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or...?
LAMA SU
Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic!
OBI-WAN
(astonished)
The Republic?
LAMA SU
We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic. 66 INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT – LATE DAY 66
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.
TAUN WE
I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep well.
TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

OBI-WAN
Arfour, Arfour...
67 EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) – LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan’s Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi- Wan’s Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.
68 INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT – LATE DAY 68
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.
OBI-WAN
Arfour, relay this, “scramble code five,” to Courscant: care of “the old folks home.”
69 EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) – LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.
70 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVING QUARTERS – EARLY EVENING 70 YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The signal is very weak, the image fades in and out.
OBI-WAN (V.O.)
...I’ve never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master? MACE WINDU
No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you. OBI-WAN (V.O.)
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we’re looking for.
71 CONTINUED: 71
YODA
Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
OBI-WAN (V.O.)
I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force...
The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.
MACE WINDU
A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone’s out to start a war.
YODA
Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
MACE WINDU
Who do you think this imposter, Sido-Dyas could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head. 72 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT – NIGHT 72
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.
73 INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN’S BEDROOM –
NIGHT 73
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.
ANAKIN
No... No... No... Mom!... Don’t, no, don’t!
74 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS – MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PADMÉ comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.
ANAKIN
(eyes closed)
Don’t go.
PADMÉ
I don’t want to disturb you.
ANAKIN
Your presence is soothing.
Brief pause.
74 CONTINUED: 74
PADMÉ
You had a nightmare again last night.
ANAKIN
Jedi don’t have nightmares.
PADME
I heard you.
ANAKIN opens his eyes and looks at her.
ANAKIN
I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She is suffering, Padmé. She is in pain... They’re killing her!
(getting up)
I know I’m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I’m sorry, Padmé. I don’t have a choice. PADMÉ
Annie, I told you I wouldn’t let you give up your future for me. I’ll go

with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won’t be disobeying your mandate.
ANAKIN
What about Master Obi-wan?
PADMÉ smiles and takes his hand.
PADMÉ
I guess we won’t tell him, will we?
75 EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM – DAY 75
ANAKIN and PADMÉ step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.
PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin’s Starship takes off.
76 EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) – DAY 76
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.
77 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAY 77
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett’s apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.
77 CONTINUED: 77
As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.
TAUN WE
Boba, is your father here?
There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.
TAUN WE
(continuing)
May we see him?
BOBA FETT
Sure.
Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.
78 INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT – DAY 78
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI- WAN looks around the room.
BOBA FETT
Dad! Taun We’s here!
JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He

is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.
TAUN WE
Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive?
JANGO FETT
Fairly.
OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.
TAUN WE
This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He’s come to check on our progress.
JANGO FETT
That right?
JANGO FETT’s eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.
OBI-WAN
Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
JANGO FETT
I’m just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.
OBI-WAN
Aren’t we all?
78 CONTINUED: 78
OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN’S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Ever make your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
JANGO FETT
Once or twice.
OBI-WAN
Recently?
JANGO FETT
(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
Possibly...
OBI-WAN
Then you must know Master Sido-Dyas?
JANGO FETT

Boba, close the door.
BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.
JANGO FETT
(continuing)
Master who?
OBI-WAN
Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi who hired you for this job?
JANGO FETT
Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
OBI-WAN
No? I thought...
TAUN WE
Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedi’s involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested.
OBI-WAN
Curious...
JANGO FETT
Do you like your army?
78 CONTINUED: (2) 78
OBI-WAN
It seems to me it’s your army – being that they are all clones of you. JANGO FETT
(grinning)
They’ll do their job well, I’ll guarantee that.
OBI-WAN
I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango.
JANGO FETT
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.
BOBA FETT
What is it, Dad?
79 EXT. SPACE 79
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.
80 EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO’S SHIP – DAY 80

The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADMÉ ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn’t seen for years. Finally, they come to Watto’s shop, and the rickshaw stops.
ANAKIN
(to the droid driver)
Wait, please.
ANAKIN and PADMÉ get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.
WATTO
(yelling, in Huttese)
No, not that one – that one!
ANAKIN
(arriving)
Excuse me, Watto.
WATTO
(in Huttese)
What?
ANAKIN
(in Huttese)
I said excuse me.
WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.
WATTO
(in Huttese)
Shut down.
The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.
WATTO
(continuing, in Huttese)
What? I don’t know you... What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn’t do it.
WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese
ANAKIN
Let me help you with that.
ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I’m looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADMÉ, then back to ANAKIN.
WATTO
Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin’s hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.
WATTO
(continuing; in
English)
You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat.
WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.
WATTO
(continuing)
You sure sprouted! Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some deadbeats who owe...
ANAKIN
My mother...
WATTO
Oh, yeah. Shmi... she’s not mine no more. I sold her.
ANAKIN
Sold her...
WATTO
Years ago. Sorry, Annie, but you know, business is business.
(more)
80 CONTINUED: (2) 80
WATTO (cont’d)
Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
ANAKIN
Do you know where they are?
WATTO
Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think...
ANAKIN
I’d like to know.
ANAKIN’S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly. WATTO
Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let’s go look in my records.
ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

81 EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) – DAY 81
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenly streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.
82 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAY 82
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.
LAMA SU
Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them.
OBI-WAN
I won’t forget.
83 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving rain. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.
Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.
84 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAY 84
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.
85 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FETT APARTMENT – DAY 85
OBI-WAN arrives at the door to Jango Fett’s apartment. He reaches up and runs his fingers along the door, locating the lock. The door slides open.
86 INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT – DAY 86
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open – clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts’ personal belongings are gone.
OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.
87 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) – DAY

JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:
BOBA FETT
Dad!!
JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.
JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI- WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.
The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.
JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter’s armour.
IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett’s ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.
OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up – feinting.
IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.
OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter’s shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:
IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.
87 CONTINUED 87
OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi’s hand.
The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.
IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:
OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air

and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.
JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.
OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI- WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.
Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.
OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared. JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot’s seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.
OUTSIDE, Jango Fett’s ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:
A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.
88 EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD – LATE DAY 88
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADMÉ get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.
PADME
Stay with the ship, Artoo.
ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADMÉ start down the trail toward the homestead.
89 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM – LATE DAY 89
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADMÉ arrive,

C-3PO
Good evening. May I help you?
ANAKIN
Threepio?
C-3PO
Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padmé.
PADMÉ
Hello, Threepio.
ANAKIN
I’ve come to see my mother.
C-3PO
Oh, dear! I’m so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
PADMÉ
Threepio, what’s happened?
C-3PO
I think we’d better go inside.
89 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD – LATE DAY 89 ANAKIN, PADMÉ and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.
C-3PO
Master Lars – Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard. ANAKIN
I’m Anakin Skywalker. I’m here looking for my mother.
OWEN
Owen Lars... I guess I’m your step-brother.
(they shake hands)
This is my girlfriend, Beru.
BERU
Hello.
PADMÉ
I’m Padmé.
OWEN
I had a feeling you might show up some day.
90 CONTINUED: 90
ANAKIN
Is my mother here?
CLIEGG
No, she’s not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.
CLIEGG
(continuing)
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.
91 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN – LATE DAY 91 BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...
CLIEGG (O.S.)
It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.
92 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA – LATE DAY 92 CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.
CLIEGG
Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they’re vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I’d be with them, only... I just couldn’t ride any more... until I heal.
CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.
CLIEGG
(continuing)
This isn’t the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn’t how your mother and I planned it. I don’t want to give up on her, but she’s been gone a month. There’s little hope she’s lasted this long.
Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.
OWEN
Where are you going?
92 CONTINUED: 92
ANAKIN
To find my mother.
PADMÉ
No, Annie!
CLIEGG
She’s dead, son. Accept it.
ANAKIN

I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she’s alive.
ANAKIN turns abruptly.
93 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM – LATE DAY 93
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADMÉ comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADMÉ.
ANAKIN
You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padmé. You’ll be safe.
OWEN
Take my speeder bike.
PADMÉ
Anakin...
PADMÉ hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen’s speeder bike, which is standing close by.
ANAKIN
I trust you’ll watch over her, Owen.
OWEN
Don’t worry.
ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.
ANAKIN
I won’t be long.
ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADMÉ watches him go.
94 EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS 94
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett’s ship appears, heading toward it.
95 INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS 95
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.
JANGO FETT
Nearly there, son.
95 CONTINUED: 95
JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:
BOBA FETT
Dad, look!!
On the view screen, Obi-Wan’s ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.
JANGO FETT
Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.
96 EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS 96
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, dodging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan’s fighter as one of Jango’s missiles gets through.
Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.
In JANGO FETT’S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.
BOBA FETT
Dad! Watch out!
JANGO FETT
Stay calm, son. We’ll be fine. That Jedi won’t be able to follow us through this.
But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.
IN OBI-WAN’S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI- WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.
IN JANGO’S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan’s ship appears to smash into the asteroid.
BOBA FETT
Got him! Yeahhhhh!
JANGO FETT
We won’t see him again.
BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett’s ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.
97 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP – SUNSET 97
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.
98 EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE – TWILIGHT 98 ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.
He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO

EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.
99 EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 99 THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.
100 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 100
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.
101 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 101
PADMÉ is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.
102 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD – GARAGE (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 102
PADMÉ stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:
C-3PO
Please don’t leave us, Miss Padmé. These people need your help. THREEPIO is parked in a corner.
PADMÉ
I’m not leaving, Threepio. I just can’t sleep.
C-3PO
That’s something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I’m either active or inactive. There’s no in-between.
PADMÉ
I guess you’re lucky.
C-3PO
Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn’t expect...
PADMÉ
You’re not happy here?
102 CONTINUED: 102
C-3PO
Oh, I’m not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn’t wish to trouble them, it’s just... being like this... well, it’s embarrassing.
PADMÉ
Being like what?

C-3PO
Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It’s so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
PADMÉ
I guess I wouldn’t like it at all.
C-3PO
Of course you wouldn’t. Nobody would. It’s simply not protocol. PADMÉ looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.
PADMÉ
Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO
I don’t think so. Only Master Annie...
PADMÉ
Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
C-3PO
Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padmé. Of course, I’m just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
PADMÉ picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.
PADMÉ
Let’s see, if we put this... here...
C-3PO
Ooooh! That’s tickles.
PADMÉ
You’ll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
103 EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS 103
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid belt. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan’s Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.
104 INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS
RINGS 104
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his Fighter.
104 CONTINUED: 104
Obi-Wan’s Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis. 105 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – NIGHT 105

Obi-Wan’s ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.
Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.
The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.
106 EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL – NIGHT 106
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.
OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.
He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.
A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.
107 EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 107
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.
108 EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) – NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the walls, overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to hide him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the back. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.
109 INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUT – NIGHT 109
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.
A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the

hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.
109 CONTINUED 109
He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.
ANAKIN
Mom... Mom... Mom...
SHMI’s eyelids flutter – and barely open. They are caked with blood. SHMI
Annie...? Is it you?
SHMI’s eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp. ANAKIN
I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang on. I’m going to get you out of here...
SHMI
I’m so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete...
ANAKIN
Just stay with me, Mom. I’m going to make you well again. Everything’s going to be fine.
SHMI
You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. I’m so proud of you, Annie... so proud... I missed you so much... I love...
SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms. 110 EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL – NIGHT 110
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stops, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.
OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.
SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships down to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the

binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.
111 EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS –
DAWN 111
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere a dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.
As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin’s lightsaber switches on.
112 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – NIGHT 112
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.
OBI-WAN
“Guiding light” to “old folks home.”
113 EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING –
DAY 113
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.
114 INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE 114
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.
OBI-WAN
...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis. BAIL ORGANA
That’s outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!
OBI-WAN
The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.

114 CONTINUED: 114
PALPATINE
Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions. OBI-WAN
One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
YODA
With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
MACE WINDU
Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last. OBI-WAN
Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
YODA
Perhaps too many pieces missing from this puzzle, there are.
MACE WINDU
Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?
OBI-WAN
Let me see if I can figure out what’s going on first.
The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.
BAIL ORGANA
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.
PALPATINE
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
MACE WINDU
We must stop them soon before they’re fully ready.
SENATOR ASK AAK
The debate is over, now we need that clone army...
BAIL ORGANA
Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
MAS AMEDDA
This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army, in a minute. PALPATINE
 
Please, please, I don’t wish to have emergency powers. That’s too extreme a solution. It’s akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis? MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.
YODA
Two hundred,... less or more.
BAIL ORGANA
With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.
MACE WINDU
Patience. We should wait for Obi-Wan to report back. We don’t know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it’s speculation.
SENATOR ASK AAK
But we must prepare for the worst. I’m going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!
PALPATINE
Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.
MAS AMEDDA
If only Senator Amidala were here.
JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.
JAR JAR
Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues, I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I’m sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo, would agree.
SENATOR ASK AAK
Thank you, Representative Binks.
Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.
114 CONTINUED: (3) 114
PALPATINE
If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day ofmy life.
115 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM – DAY 115
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.
116 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAY 116
PADMÉ fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

PADMÉ
There!
PADMÉ stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn’t the golden figure we know because PADMÉ has had to use whatever stuff she could find in the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.
C-3PO
Um. How do I look?
OWEN
Great! You look perfect.
C-3PO
Perfect? Oh, Miss Padmé, I’m so happy!
(extending his hand to shake hers)
Oh, pardon me.
THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.
THREEPIO
(continuing)
Thank you.
He forgets formality and hugs her. PADMÉ hugs him back, laughing. C-3PO
(continuing)
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
OWEN
(grinning)
Well, Padmé, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want.
C-3PO
Oh, my!
Then suddenly, from outside:
BERU (V.O.)
Come topside, everybody! He’s back! He’s back.
117 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM – DAY 117
PADMÉ and OWEN run out onto the cbaut to join BERU. THREEPIO follows. CLIEGG hobbles out of the homestead on his speeder chair. They stand looking out into the desert, where ANAKIN rides the speeder bike toward the homestead. SHMI’S BODY is tied to it. ANAKIN arrives. They run to him as he steps away from the bike, carrying SHM1. He stops, face-to-face with CLIEGG. There is a brief pause. Then he carries SHMI into the homestead.

118 INT TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAY 118
PADMÉ comes in with a tray of food. ANAKIN is kneeling by the speeder bike, using an electronic wrench to work on it.
ANAKIN
The shifter broke. Life seems so much simpler when you’re fixing things.
PADMÉ puts the tray down
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I’m good at fixing things... always was. But I couldn’t...
(stops working, tears
in his eyes)
Why did she have to die? Why couldn’t I save her? I know I could have!
PADMÉ
Sometimes there are things no one can fix. You’re not all-powerful, Annie.
ANAKIN starts working with the wrench again.
ANAKIN
(angry)
I should be! Someday I will be... I will be the most powerful Jedi ever! I promise you, I will even learn to stop people from dying.
PADMÉ
Anakin...
ANAKIN
(furious)
It’s all Obi-Wan’s fault. He’s jealous! He knows I’m already more powerful than he is. He’s holding me back!
ANAKIN hurls the wrench across the garage. It CLATTERS to the floor. He looks at his trembling hands. PADMÉ stares at him, shocked.
PADMÉ
Annie, what’s wrong?
ANAKIN
I... I killed them. I killed them all. They’re dead, every single one of them...
ANAKIN focuses on her like someone returning from far away. ANAKIN
(continuing)
Not just the men... the women and children too. They’re like animals,

and I slaughtered them like animals... I hate them!
118 CONTINUED: 118
There is silence for a moment, then ANAKIN breaks down, sobbing. PADMÉ takes him into her arms.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Why do I hate them? I didn’t... I couldn’t... I couldn’t control myself. I... I don’t want to hate them... but I just can’t forgive them.
PADMÉ
To be angry is to be human.
ANAKIN
To control your anger is to be a Jedi.
PADMÉ
Ssshhh... you’re human.
ANAKIN
No. I’m a Jedi. I know I’m better than this. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry! PADMÉ
You’re like everyone else...
PADMÉ rocks him, and ANAKIN weeps.
119 EXT. GEONOSIS, TOWER ENTRANCE – DAWN 119
Light grows on the clustering tower of fantastic stalagmites. OBI-WAN sneaks up to the main one. He climbs up the side of the tower to a small window-like opening. OBI-WAN looks around quickly, then sneaks inside.
120 INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS – MORNING 120
OBI-WAN makes his way along a narrow, pillared corridor. He comes to what looks like a large open well or vent shaft. He looks down and sees a huge underground facility below. In one area, machines are constructing BATTLE DROIDS. In another area, completed DROIDS are moving along a conveyor belt. GEONOSIS WORKERS, with no wings, drone away at the assembly line.
221 INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE – MORNING 121 OBI-WAN arrives at a vast expanse in the stalagmite interior. Immense pillars, soaring Gaudi-Gothic arches, vaulted roofs. The huge space is deserted – completely silent.
OBI-WAN starts to cross the square. Suddenly he hears voices.
He darts behind a pillar as POGGLE THE LESSER (Archduke of Geonosis), his aid, SUN RIT, COUNT DOOKU, and NUTE GUNRAY approach, closely followed by PASSEL ARGENTE and WAT TAMBOR. COUNT DOOKU is tall, elderly, and saturnine, with

beautiful
121 CONTINUED: 121
manners. OBI-WAN flattens himself against the pillar as they pass by.
POGGLE
We’re already running at maximum capacity. In less than two months, Viceroy, you’ll have the finest army in the galaxy.
NUTE GUNRAY
Our early testing of your prototype units has been satisfying, but these new Battle Droids are a little less precise than I had hoped. POGGLE
I’m sure their advanced features will more than make up for that. COUNT DOOKU
Now, we must persuade the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty, then nothing in the universe will be able to stop us.
NUTE GUNRAY
What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I’m not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.
COUNT DOOKU
She will be soon, Viceroy. I am a man of my word, and I have faith in this bounty hunter’s abilities.
They move out of earshot. OBI-WAN peers around the pillar to see them going through an archway on the far side of the courtyard. There is a flight of stairs beside it.
OBI-WAN arrives at the stairs. He sneaks up them, to arrive at a narrow gothic archway. He looks down through it.
122 INT. GEONOSIS, CONFERENCE ROOM – DAY 122
POGGLE THE LESSER, and his TWO AIDES are at one end of a large’ round conference table.
COUNT DOOKU
Now is the time, my friends. The moment when you have to decide between the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. COUNT DOOKU is at the head of the table. JANGO FETT stands behind his chair.
In addition to the original group, there are also THREE OPPOSITION SENATORS, PO NUDO, TESSEK and TOONBUCK TOORA, and a COMMERCE GUILD DIGNITARY, SHU MAI and a MEMBER of the INTERGALACTIC BANK CLAN, SAN HILL.
122 CONTINUED: 122

COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
A hundred more systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen. And let me remind you of our absolute commitment to capitalism... of the lower taxes, the reduced tariffs, and the eventual abolition of all trade barriers. Signing this treaty will bring you profits beyond your wildest imagination.
(looks at Nute)
Our friends in the Trade Federation have pledged their support. When their droid battalions are combined with yours, we shall have an army greater than anything in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make MSEL ARGENTE, THE CORPORATE ALLIANCE REPRESENTATIVE, stands.
PASSEL ARGENTE
I am authorized by the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.
COUNT DOOKU
We are most grateful for your cooperation, Chairman.
SHU MAI, the Commerce Guild Representative, stands.
SHU MAI
The Commerce Guilds do not at this time wish to become openly involved. But we shall support you in secret – and look forward to doing business with you.
There are chuckles around the table. COUNT DOOKU smiles. COUNT DOOKU
That is all we ask.
SAN HILL, the banker, stands.
SAN HILL
The Intergalactic Banking Clan will support you wholeheartedly, but only in a non-exclusive arrangement
123 INT. GEONOSIS, STAIRS – DAY 123
OBI-WAN pulls back from the archway.
124 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – DAY 124
The canopy of Obi-Wan’s Starship is covered with SMALL CRAWLING CREATURES. The ARFOUR DROID WHIMPERS as the CREATURES back the little DROID against a rock wall.
125 INT. GEONOSIS# STAIRS AND WINDOW – DAY 125 OBI-WAN hears the DROID WHIMPER through his comlink. He starts up the stairs, coming to an outside window. OBI-WAN takes out his binoculars as he talk into his camlink.

OBI-WAN
Arfour, Arfour... Where are you?!?
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, OBI-WAN sees the DROID being chased off by the CRAWLING CREATURES, (ROGAS). He puts the binoculars away and climbs the stairs.
126 EXT. GEONOSIS, TOP OF STALAGMITE – DAY 126
OBI-WAN arrives at the top of the stalagmite. The view is staggering. He pulls a length of wire from his utility belt and attaches it to a small chrome ball that takes the wire high into the air. He clips a little booster device to the wire. A SHADOW passes over him. He doesn’t notice.
OBI-WAN
(into comlink)
Artoo Detoo... Artoo Detoo. Do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Switch to low band.
OBI-WAN listens for a moment then hears a little BEEP.
127 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARFIGHTER. – DAY 127
In the ship, ARTOO BEEPS as he receives the message.
OBI-WAN (V.0.)
Record this message and take it to your mistress, Padmé... and the Jedi Skywalker... “Anakin, my long range transmitter is knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant.”
128 EXT. GEONOSIS, TOP OF STALAGMITE – DAY 128 OBI-WAN talks into his comlink. More SHADOWS pass over him, lower now. He doesn’t notice
OBI-WAN
... the Trade Federation is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala.
The SHAIDOWS are lower.
128 CONTINUED: 128
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!
A SHADOW passes very low. OBI-WAN looks up quickly.
129 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARFIGHTER – DAY 129
ARTOO dutifully listens to the desperate meseage.
OBI-WAN (V.0.)
...attack...! don’t... make it... too many... aaaggghhh!
Obi-Wan’s voice cuts out. ARTOO WHISTLES in dismay.

130 EXT. TATOOINE,, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTRAD – DAY 130
The ramp lowers. ARTOO rolls down and trundles off toward the bomestead.
131 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GRAVESITE – DAY 131 ANAKIN, PADMÉ, CLIEGG, OWEN, BERU, and THREEPIO are standinq around Shmi’s grave.
CLIEGG
I know wherever you are it’s become a better place. You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Goodbye, my dearest wife. And thank you.
Brief pause.
ANAKIN
I wasn’t strong enough to save you, Mom. But I promise I won’t fail again... I miss you so much.
Silence. Then BEEPS and WHISTLES are heard. They turn as ARTOO rolls up.
PADMÉ
Artoo, what are you doing here?
ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
C-3PO
It seems he carrying a message from someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. Does that mean anything to you, Master Anakin?
132 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAY 132
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADMÉ and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.
OBI-WAN
...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don’t... make it... aaaggghhh!
The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.
ANAKIN
I’m going after him!
PADMÉ
I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
ANAKIN
Yeah, you’re right, you’re right.
133 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM – LATE DAY 133

ANAKIN, PADMÉ, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.
134 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – SUNSET 134
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADMÉ. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.
MACE WINDU
We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.
ANAKIN
Understood, Master.
The hologram switches off. PADMÉ is looking at the readout on the ship’s control panel.
PADMÉ
They’ll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away. PADMÉ starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.
ANAKIN
If he’s still alive.
134 CONTINUED: 134
PADMÉ
Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He’s your friend... your mentor...
ANAKIN
...He’s like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
PADMÉ
He gave you strict orders to protect me...
PADMÉ pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
...and I’m going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along.
ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.
135 EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD – SUNSET 135
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

136 EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE – DAY 136
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.
137 INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER – DAY 137
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.
MACE WINDU
The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku’s armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.
All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.
YODA
Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let’s hope they are.
138 INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER – DAY 138 Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATORS yell furiously at one another.
138 CONTINUED 138
MAS AMEDDA
Order! Order!!
Finally, the uproar dies.
PALPATINE
In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises the Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks.
Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.
JAR JAR
Senators, dellow felagates...
Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.
MAS AMEDDA
Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing!
Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.
JAR JAR
In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate

emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.
JAR JAR
(continuing)
Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men!
ORN FREE TAA
We won’t support a dictator.
SHOUTS of agreement.
JAR JAR
That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Our ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before! 138 CONTINUED: (2) 138
Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.
PALPATINE rises.
PALPATINE
It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to rule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace. MAS AMEDDA
We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal aye at this time... those opposed?
139 EXT. SPACE 139
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.
140 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA 140
The Naboo Starship lands.
141 INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER – DAY 141
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADMÉ is in the co-pilot’s seat. She gets up.

ANAKIN
Hey, where are you going?
PADMÉ
To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.
ANAKIN
No! You’re not!
He grabs her arm.
PADMÉ
Let go of me!
141 CONTINUED: 141
ANAKIN
I’m not letting you go out there. It’s too dangerous.
PADMÉ
What?!?
ANAKIN
It’s my job to protect you. I said it’s too dangerous. You’re not going, and that’s final!
PADMÉ
Don’t you give me orders, Annie! I’m a Senator of the Galactica Republica. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man.
(standing up)
Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It’s up to you. PADMÉ storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.
ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
C-3PO
Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they’re generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I’m programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.
ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.
142 INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS – DAY 142
ANAKIN and PADMÉ enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.
PADMÉ
(in a low voice)
It’s empty!
They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to

pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.
143 INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE – DAY 143
ANAKIN and PADMÉ cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.
PADMÉ
Wait!
143 CONTINUED: 143
TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.
The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.
COUNT DOOKU
Senator Amidala, I’ve heard so much about you.
PADMÉ
Count Dooku, I assume.
COUNT DOOKU
I’m delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
PADMÉ
Don’t worry he’s housebroken.
144 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) – DAY 144
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADMÉ on the far side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him. PADMÉ
You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.
COUNT DOOKU
He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe.
COUNT DOOKU smiles.
PADMÉ
He is an officer of the Republic. You can’t do that.
COUNT DOOKU
We don’t recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency.
ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn’t turn it on.

PADMÉ
And if I don’t join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?
144 CONTINUED: 144
COUNT DOOKU
I don’t wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what’s in their best interest. Aren’t you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren’t you? Be honest, Senator.
PADMÉ
The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing. COUNT DOOKU
You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.
PADMÉ
If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.
COUNT DOOKU
The Chancellor means well, M’Lady, but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
PADMÉ
I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it’s business becoming government!
COUNT DOOKU
Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.
PADMÉ
What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
144 CONTINUED: (2) 144
DOOKU
I wouldn’t think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who

have a strong interest in your demise, M’Lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I’m afraid. It’s purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I’m sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I’m sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I’ve done all I can for you.
JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN. JANGO FETT
I’ll take that weapon.
ANAKIN hesitates.
COUNT DOOKU
You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape.
PADMÉ
Anakin...
ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.
145 INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER – DAY 145 ANAKIN and PADMÉ are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.
SUN RIT
You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage.
POGGLE
Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out? PADMÉ
You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.
POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.
145 CONTINUED: 145
POGGLE
We build weapons, Senator... that is our business! Of course we’re prepared!
NUTE GUNRAY
Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.

POGGLE
Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena!
FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.
146 INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 146 In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.
The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.
ANAKIN
Don’t be afraid.
PADMÉ
I’m not afraid to die. I’ve been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
ANAKIN
What are you talking about?
PADMÉ
I love you.
ANAKIN
You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
PADMÉ
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can’t control it... and now I don’t care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
PADMÉ leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for their lips to meet. They kiss.
ANAKIN
I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.
146 CONTINUED: 146
They kiss again.
The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there is a HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena
147 INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 147
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling

GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts that are three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADMÉ and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADMÉ is in the center.
OBI-WAN
I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
ANAKIN
I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
OBI-WAN
It looks like you’re going a good job so far.
Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.
SUN RIT
The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.
The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.
POGGLE
Let the executions begin!
The crowd goes wild.
ANAKIN
I have a bad feeling about this.
From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.
The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.
OBI-WAN
Take the one the left. I’ll take the one on the right.
ANAKIN
What about Padmé?
PADMÉ has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to

the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.
OBI-WAN
It looks like she’s already on top of things.
The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post
OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.
The NEXU arrives at PADMÉ’S post and rears on its hind legs. On top, PADMÉ struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.
In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.
In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR’s long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.
ANAKIN’s REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK’s mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.
The NEXU’s claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADMÉ. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADMÉ jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.
In the archducal box:
NUTE GUNRAY
Foul!! She can’t do that... shoot her or something!
In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and

makes to leap up at PADMÉ again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.
147 CONTINUED: (2) 147
ANAKIN
You okay? PADMÉ
(nods, gasping) Sure! Well, sort of. ANAKIN
Jump!!!
The NEXU springs. PADMÉ leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.
In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.
NUTE GUNRAY
This isn’t how it’s supposed to be! Jango, finish her off.
COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to stay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.
COUNT DOOKU
(smiling enigmatically)
Patience, Viceroy... she will die. Maybe this is the way it’s supposed to end.
OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.
148 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – DAY 148
ARTOO BEEPS
C-3PO
Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something’s happened to them?
ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
C-3PO
(continuing)
Danger? Oh no, I shouldn’t think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.
149 EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 149

In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit. 149 CONTINUED: 149
COUNT DOOKU
Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You’re just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.
MACE WINDU
Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party’s over.
MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU’S lips curl in slight amusement.
COUNT DOOKU
(to Mace Windu)
Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You’re impossibly outnumbered. MACE WINDU
I don’t think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians. COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows. COUNT DOOKU
It wasn’t the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids?
COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.
MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle begins. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cut down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect. The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADMÉ picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.
Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and

DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADMÉ blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.
150 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP 150
ARTOO whistles.
150 CONTINUED: 150
C-3PO
I don’t hear anything.
(Artoo beeps)
You’re scaring me! Stop imagining things!
151 EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 151
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have knocked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted. The rest are retreating into the arena.
ANAKIN and PADMÉ are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter’s body falls to the ground.
MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.
OBI-WAN
Someone’s got to – shut down – these droids.
MACE WINDU
Don’t worry! It’s being – taken care of!
152 EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP – DAY 152 KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.
153 INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS – DAY 153
KI-ADI-MUNDI and the surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.
154 INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE – DAY 154
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS.

The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KI-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!
There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. On the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.
PLO KOON
We’ve done it! Now we have a chance!
154 CONTINUED: 154
Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI- MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
The system’s off but they’re still active. That’s a new feature. They are independent of the control system.
155 EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 155
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADMÉ and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.
At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father’s battered helmet. He picks it up.
KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.
In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.
COUNT DOOKU
Master Windu!
Silence.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished.
(pauses briefly)
Surrender – and your lives will be spared.
MACE WINDU
We will not be hostages for you to barter with, Dooku.

COUNT DOOKU
Then, I’m sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADMÉ clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADMÉ looks up suddenly and whispers to ANAKIN.
PADMÉ
Look!
Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.
155 CONTINUED: 155
YODA
Come on – hurry! Hurry!
The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.
156 EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 156
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.
157 INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE – DAY 157
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.
YODA
More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.
The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.
158 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – DAY 158
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.
C-3PO
I’m sure I heard something, this time. Didn’t you? It’s probably just a celebration
ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

159 EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAY 159 Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.
160 INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAY 160
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADMÉ are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.
The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.
OBI-WAN
Hold on! Look over there...
160 CONTINUED: 160
Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.
ANAKIN
It’s Dooku, go after him!
The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADMÉ tumbles out.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Padmé!!!
ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADMÉ hits thr ground below. ANAKIN
(continuing; to pilot)
Put the ship down! Down!
OBI-WAN
No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
ANAKIN
No we’re not!! Land this ship!
OBI-WAN
Don’t let your personal feelings get in the way. We’ve got a job to do. Below, PADMÉ hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.
ANAKIN
I don’t care!.. Go back.
OBI-WAN
Anakin! She’s all right! Look.
ANAKIN stares out to see PADMÉ rescued by CLONE TROOPERS. OBI-WAN

(continuing)
Follow that speeder!
On the ground, PADMÉ looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder descends rapidly; the Gunship follows.
Count Dooku’s speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower. 161 INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER – LATE DAY 161 COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.
DROID CAPTAIN
Your Excellency!
161 CONTINUED: 161
COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.
COUNT DOOKU
That won’t be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me.
The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement. OBI-WAN
(to Anakin)
We move in together – you slowly on the...
ANAKIN
I’m taking him now!
OBI-WAN
Anakin, no!
ANAKIN
You’ll pay for all the Jedi you’ve killed today, Dooku.
ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN.
COUNT DOOKU
Kenobi, isn’t it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond

yours. Now, back down.
OBI-WAN
I don’t think so.
OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles. COUNT DOOKU
Ah, but if I must.
COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
OBI-WAN
You will have to prove it.
OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU’S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman – elegant, graceful, classical – a master of the old style.
161 CONTINUED: 161
COUNT DOOKU
Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
Surely you can do better...?
(parries)
No, I’m surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me?
(cuts)
Which is it?
COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
Come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery.
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku’s superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI- WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.
OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.
COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku’s lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against – Anakin’s lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball. COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
That’s brave of you, boy – but foolish. I would have thought you’d have learnt your lesson.
ANAKIN
I’m a slow learner.
And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin’s lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood where Anakin has nicked him.
COUNT DOOKU
You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enough to save you this time.
161 CONTINUED: (2) 161
ANAKIN
Don’t bet on it!
OBI-WAN
Anakin!
OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It’s no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin’s arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace. Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.
Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and

the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.
Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.
COUNT DOOKU
Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.
YODA
Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have.
COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn’t budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.
YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda’s speed and swordplay. His lightsaber is a humming blur of light.
Count Dooku’s lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU’S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count’s head.
YODA
(continuing)
The end for you, Count, this is.
COUNT DOOKU
...Not yet...
COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.
161 CONTINUED 161
ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI-WAN tries to get out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship’s engines are heard starting up.
YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground.

DOOKU’S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it’s too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.
PADMÉ
Anakin!
PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders?
YODA looks at him and sighs.
162 EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN – DAWN 162
COUNT DOOKU’S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU maneuvers the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.
163 INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM –
DAWN 163
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.
COUNT DOOKU
The Force is with us, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.
COUNT DOOKU
I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun.
DARTH SIDIOUS
Excellent.
(smiling)
Everything is going as planned.
164 EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE – SUNSET 164
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.
165 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER – SUNSET 165 MACE WINDU
Where is your apprentice?
OBI-WAN
On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home. They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory. YODA
Victory? Victory, you say?
OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.
YODA
(continuing)
Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!
166 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN – LATE DAY 166
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling lake, ANAKIN and PADMÉ stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.
THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.
167 EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY – LATE DAY 167
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.
On the balcony, PALPATINE’s expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches somberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.
The Great Clone War has begun...
FADE OUT


Title: Revenge of the Sith

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
A vast sea of stars serves as a backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.
War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.
In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Republic.
As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor...
PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighers as theu maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin’s ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan’s ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.
2 INT. OBI-WAN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 2
OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.
3 INT. ANAKIN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 3
ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.
ANAKIN
There isn’t a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor...
OBI-WAN
Look out, four droids inbound...
4 EXT. CORUSCANT – SPACE BATTLE 4
The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.
5 INT. OBI-WAN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 5
OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.
OBI-WAN
We’ve got to split them up.
ANAKIN

Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.
OBI-WAN
Easy for you to say... why am I always the bait?
ANAKIN
Don’t worry, I’m coming around behind you.
OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship’s superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, they’re all over me!
ANAKIN
Dead ahead! Closing... lock onto him, Artoo...
ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES. ANAKIN
(continuing, laugs)
We got him, Artoo!
ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.
ANAKIN
I copy, Artoo.
OBI-WAN
I’m going down on the deck.
ANAKIN
Good idea... I need some room to maneuver.
OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the sruface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don’t let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.
OBI-WAN
Hurry up! I don’t like this!
OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap beween two towers on a

Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan’s wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan’s Astro Droid, ARFOUR.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Ouch!
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Don’t even try to fix it, Arfour. I’ve shut it down.
ANAKIN
We’re locked on... we’ve got him...
ANAKIN drops behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Yeah! We got him... good going, Artoo.
OBI-WAN
Next time you’re the bait... Now let’s find the Command Ship and get on with it...
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
ANAKIN
Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous’s ship is directly ahead.
ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin’s cockpit. ANAKIN
(continuing)
The one crawing with vulture droids.
6 INT. OBI-WAN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT –
SPACE 6
OBI-WAN
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configurations, lift off the cruiser, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.
ANAKIN
Come on, Master.
OBI-WAN
Not this time. There’s too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do

you copy?
ODD BALL (OS)
Copy, Red Leader.
OBI-WAN
Mark my position and form your squad up behind me...
7 INT. ODD BALL’S FIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 7
ODD BALL
We’re on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.
The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.
8 INT. ANAKIN’S FIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE
8
ANAKIN
This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.
ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.
OBI-WAN
Add five Tri-fighters on the right...
ANAKIN
I’m going head to head. See you.
OBI-WAN
Take it easy, Anakin.
Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.
ODD BALL
I’m on your right, Red Leader.
ANAKIN
Incoming!!
ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.
OBI-WAN
Five more on the right!
Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.
ANAKIN
Here we go.
The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID

TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them, BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.
OBI-WAN
I’m going high and right.
ANAKIN
Hang on. There are four more of them.
OBI-WAN
Stay with me... swing back and right... help me engage. Back off... Let them pass between us.
ANAKIN
I’m coming around. I’m coming around your tail.
OBI-WAN
All right, engage... and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI- FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.
ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.
ANAKIN
How many back there, Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three... (continuing) Four... that’s not good.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, you have four on your tail.
ANAKIN
I know, I know!
OBI-WAN
Four more closing from your left.
ANAKIN
I know, I know!
OBI-WAN
Break right and go high.
ANAKIN
I’m going low and left.
Obi-Wan shakes his head.
OBI-WAN
(to himself)

He still has much to learn.
ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.
ANAKIN
Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I’m going to pull them through the needle . . .
OBI-WAN
Too dangerous. First Jedi rule
“Survive.”
ANAKIN
Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little. OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN
Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) You’ll never get through there, Anakin. It’s too tight. ARTOO BEEPS nervously.
ANAKIN
Easy, Artoo . . . we’ve done this before.
OBI-WAN
Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo’s squeal reads out, “WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.”
ANAKIN
Wrong thought, Artoo.
ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I’m through.
OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.

Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS. ODD BALL
There are too many of them.
CLONE PILOT 2
I’m on your wing. Break left. Break left. They’re all over me. Get them off my . . .
ANAKIN
I’m going to go help them out!
OBI-WAN
No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.
ANAKIN
Missiles! Pull up!
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI- WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.
OBI-WAN
They overshot us . . .
The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan’s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan’s ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them. ANAKIN
They’re coming around!
OBI-WAN
All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
ANAKIN
Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.
ANAKIN
We got ‘em. Artoo!
Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.
OBI-WAN
Flying is for droids.
Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward

the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I’m hit! Anakin?
ANAKIN
I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan’s ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.
OBI-WAN
Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .
ARFOUR’s head gets ripped off and flies away.
OBI-WAN
Oh dear. They’re shutting down all the controls.
ANAKIN
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
OBI-WAN
The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I’m running out of tricks here.
ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan’s left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi- Wan’s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan’s ship.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) In the name of ...
ANAKIN
Steady . . . steady . . .
OBI-WAN
Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You’re not helping here. ANAKIN
I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . OBI-WAN
Wait . . . wait . . . I can’t see a thing! My cockpit’s fogging. They’re all over me, Anakin.
ANAKIN
Move to the right.
OBI-WAN

Hold on, Anakin. You’re going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There’s nothing more you can do.
ANAKIN
I’m not leaving without you, Master.
ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN’s and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN’s ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan’s ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi’s view.
ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin’s ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.
OBI-WAN
Blast it ... I can’t see . . . my controls are gone. ANAKIN
Get ‘em, Artoo. Watch out!
OBI-WAN
Artoo, hit the buzz droid’s center eye.
ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.
ANAKIN
Yeah, you got him!
OBI-WAN
Great, Artoo.
ANAKIN
Stay on my wing . . . the General’s Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
OBI-WAN
Have you noticed the shields are still up?
ANAKIN
Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN’s disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.
OBI-WAN
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast

doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.
ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.
ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.
OBI-WAN
Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
ANAKIN
Tap into the ship’s computers.
They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.
OBI-WAN
The Chancellor’s signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
ANAKIN
I sense Count Dooku . . .
OBI-WAN
I sense a trap.
ANAKIN
Next move?
OBI-WAN
Spring the trap.
The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.
ANAKIN
Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
OBI-WAN
Here, take this, and wait for orders.
OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.
10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the

NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN. GENERAL GRIEVOUS What’s the situation, Captain? CAPTAIN
TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Just as Count Dooku predicted.
11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.
BODYGUARD I
General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We’ve been waiting for you. OBI-WAN
We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.
As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.
OBI-WAN
Anakin. . .
ANAKIN
Ready.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.
12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.
OBI-WAN
. . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That’s why they’ve stopped shooting.
ANAKIN
Well then, we’re safe for the time being.
OBI-WAN
Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the

hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.
ANAKIN
They’re sealing this section off.
OBI-WAN
Six droids coming our way!
The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance. ANAKIN
Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.
OBI-WAN
We’ll never get through that. It’s too small!
They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI- WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.
The fuel is up to the Jedi’s chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose. ANAKIN
I found our escape vent.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We’re in serious trouble here. ANAKIN
Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a “man-sized” work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.
13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.
ANAKIN
Here’s a way out.
As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.

14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.
15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.
OBI-WAN
That won’t hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
ANAKIN
The blast will break the hull. This side’s pressurized.
OBI-WAN
You still have much to learn, Anakin.
16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.
SUPER BATTLE DROID R77
I have a bad feeling about this.
17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.
18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE
A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.
19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed. OBI-WAN
All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let’s go!
ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.
20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.
ANAKIN
Destroyers!!

Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.
BATTLE DROID
Drop your weapons! I said drop ‘em.
The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.
21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.
22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.
OBI-WAN
Did you press the stop button?
ANAKIN
No, did you?
OBI-WAN
No!
ANAKIN
Well, there’s more than one way out of here.
ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.
OBI-WAN
We don’t want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . . ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.
23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan’s voice over the comlink and are distracted. SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
What’s that?
SUPER BATTLE DROID 2
Get back to work. It’s nothing.
24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN
Artoo?
ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator. OBI-WAN
(continuing) Always on the move.
OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.

25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.
OBI-WAN
(OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.
26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.
27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator starts to descend rapidly.
OBI-WAN
Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.
28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.
DROID 1
Hands up, Jedi! Don’t move.
DROID 2
Roger, roger.
29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN’s comlink messages to ARTOO.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
There it is again.
OBI-WAN
(OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.
30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.
OBI-WAN
Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!
The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.
31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
Hey you!
ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up. 32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.
OBI-WAN
Now, that’s better . . .
33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
You stupid little astro droid!
34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft. Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
Oh, it’s you . . .
35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.
36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER ANAKIN
What was that all about?
OBI-WAN
Well, Artoo has been . . .
ANAKIN
No loose wire jokes . . . He’s doing the best he can.
OBI-WAN
Did I say anything?
ANAKIN
He’s trying!
OBI-WAN

I didn’t say anything!
37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away. 38 INT. GENERAL’S QUARTER’S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General’s Quarters.
At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor’s face.
OBI-WAN
(bows) Chancellor.
ANAKIN
Are you all right?
PALPATINE
(quietly) Count Dooku.
PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.
OBI-WAN
(quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.
ANAKIN
I was about to say that.
COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.
PALPATINE
Get help! You’re no match for him. He’s a Sith Lord.
OBI-WAN
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.
COUNT DOOKU
Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don’t want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.
OBI-WAN

You won’t get away this time, Dooku.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.
COUNT DOOKU
I’ve been looking forward to this.
ANAKIN
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
COUNT DOOKU
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You’ll have to do better.
As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General’s Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI- WAN is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don’t use them.
Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.
39 INT. GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU’s hands. The

Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord’s hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU’s defeat.
PALPATINE
Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now! ANAKIN
I shouldn’t . . .
PALPATINE
Do it!!
ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU’s head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.
ANAKIN
... I couldn’t stop myself.
PALPATINE
You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU’s lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE. ANAKIN
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral’s Chair. The Chancellor’s restraints pop loose.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I shouldn’t have done that, Chancellor. It’s not the Jedi way.
PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.
PALPATINE
It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn’t the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it’s too late.
ANAKIN
He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing’s all right. PALPATINE

Leave him, or we’ll never make it.
ANAKIN
His fate will be the same as ours.
ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.
40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Prepare for attack.
PILOT
All batteries fire! Fire!
41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER
Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying. 42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.
ANAKIN
The elevator’s not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .
ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN
(continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.
ANAKIN
(continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!
43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space. PILOT
Reverse stabilizers.
44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.
Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.
45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.

ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.
46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror. 47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
PILOT
Magnetize! Magnetize!
48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.
49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT
The TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.
50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.
ANAKIN
We can’t wait. Come on, we have to be fast.
PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.
51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Fire the emergency booster engines.
PILOT
Leveling out, sir.
52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi’s leg. As the ship

rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft. 53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.
ANAKIN
Easy. . . . We’re in a bit of a situation.
OBI-WAN
Did I miss something?
OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan’s comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.
ANAKINN
Hold on.
OBI-WAN
What is that?
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) Oops.
ANAKIN
Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
OBI-WAN
Too late! Jump!
They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.
54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.
OBI-WAN
Let’s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that’s still flyable.

Come on.
ANAKIN
Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.
56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.
57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.
OBI-WAN
None of those ships will get us anywhere.
ANAKIN
I agree.
PALPATINE
What are we going to do?
ANAKIN
I don’t know.
OBI-WAN
Don’t look at me. I don’t know.
ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin’s Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.
ANAKIN
Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
OBI-WAN
We’ll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod. ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.
58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling

and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.
59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath. ANAKIN/OBI-WAN
Well, that was close.
They laugh.
60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
BODYGUARD
General, we found the Jedi. They’re in hallway 328.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Activate ray shields.
61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway. ANAKIN
Ray shields!
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment. OBI-WAN
Wait a minute, how’d this happen! We’re smarter than this.
ANAKIN
Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
OBI-WAN
Oh, so all of a sudden it’s my fault.
ANAKIN

You’re the Master. I’m just a hero. OBI-WAN
I’m open to suggestions here. PALPATINE
Why don’t we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku’s demise, we can negotiate our release.
The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.
ANAKIN
I say . . . patience.
OBI-WAN
Patience! That’s your plan, is it?
ANAKIN
Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he’ll release the ray shields . . .
ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.
ANAKIN
(continuing) See! No problem.
Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.
SUPER BATTLE DROID
Don’t move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
OBI-WAN
Do you have a plan B?
62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We’ve been waiting for you. That wasn’t much of a rescue.
A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI’S lightsabers.
OBI-WAN
That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your

reputation to be a little older.
ANAKIN
General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You’re shorter than I expected.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .
OBI-WAN
Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
OBI-WAN
Not this time. And this time you won’t escape.
ANAKIN
Artoo.
ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General’s hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Crush them! Make them suffer!
ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General’s hand.
The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s TWO BODYGUARDS.
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Stay and watch your stations.
OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous’s BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.

OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD’S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away. ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
PILOT
Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Stay on course . . . Don’t bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD’S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
You lose, General Kenobi.
One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.
PILOT
The ship is breaking up!
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
We’ve run out of time.
OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.
63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the

DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.
PALPATINE
The hull is burning up!
64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE
GENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.
65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod. GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Time to abandon ship.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.
66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE
He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.
67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator’s chair.
ANAKIN
All the escape pods have been launched.
OBI-WAN
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
ANAKIN
You mean, do I know how to land what’s left of this thing?
ANAKIN sits in the pilot’s chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward. OBI-WAN
Well?
ANAKIN
Under the circumstances, I’d say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and

pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine ‘s controls and assists in flying the cruiser.
OBI-WAN
Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN
Pressure rising. We’ve got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
OBI-WAN
Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
A large part of the ship breaks away.
ANAKIN
We lost something.
OBI-WAN
Not to worry, we’re still flying half the ship.
ANAKIN
Now we’re really picking up speed . . . I’m going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
OBI-WAN
Careful . . . we’re heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
ANAKIN
What’s our speed?
OBI-WAN
Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we’re in the atmosphere . . . ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.
ANAKIN
Grab that . . . Keep us level.
OBI-WAN
Steady. Steady.
ANAKIN
Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
OBI-WAN
Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.
FlRESHIP PILOT
We’ll take you in.
OBI-WAN

Copy that. Landing strip’s straight ahead. ANAKIN
We’re coming in too hot.
OBI-WAN
Easy-easy.
The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.
68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM- AFTERNOON
A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.
OBI-WAN
Another happy landing.
69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON
The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.
ANAKIN
(to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?
OBI-WAN
Oh no. I’m not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
ANAKIN
Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
OBI-WAN
Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
ANAKIN
All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.

OBI-WAN
. . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let’s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
ANAKIN
All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
OBI-WAN
Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn’t count. I’ll see you at the briefing.
ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.
MACE WINDU
Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right? PALPATINE
Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
MACE WINDU
General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
PALPATINE
That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
MACE WINDU
Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority. BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.
BAIL ORGANA
Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.
ANAKIN
Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.
C-3PO
It couldn’t possibly be as bad as all that.
ARTOO beeps.
C-3PO
(continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a

tune-up myself.
70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.
BAIL ORGANA
The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor’s draconian security measures.
ANAKIN
I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that. Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.
BAIL ORGANA
I’ll do everything I can with the Senate.
ANAKIN
Excuse me.
BAIL ORGANA
Certainly.
ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.
PADME
Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you’re back.
ANAKIN
I missed you, Padme. I’ve missed you so.
PADME
There were whispers . . . that you’d been killed. I’ve been living with unbearable dread.
ANAKIN
I’m back, I’m all right. It feels like we’ve been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn’t been kidnapped. I don’t think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.
PADME
Wait, not here . . .
He grabs her again.
ANAKIN

Yes, here! I’m tired of all this deception. I don’t care if they know we’re married.
PADME
Anakin, don’t say things like that. You’re important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won’t let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
ANAKIN
I’ve given my life to the Jedi order, but I’d only give up my life, for you. PADME
(playfully) I wouldn’t like that. I wouldn’t like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.
ANAKIN
Are you all right? You’re trembling. What’s going on?
PADME
I’m just excited to see you.
ANAKIN
That’s not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
PADME
Nothing . . . nothing . . .
ANAKIN
You’re frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what’s going on!
PADME begins to cry.
PADME
You’ve been gone five months . . . it’s been very hard for me. I’ve never felt so alone. There’s . . .
ANAKIN
. . . Is there someone else?
PADME
(peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don’t trust me. Nothing has changed.
ANAKIN
(sheepish) I’m afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that’s all.
PADME
I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you. ANAKIN
It’s just that I’ve never seen you like this . . .
PADME
Something wonderful has happened.

They look at each other for a long moment.
PADME
(continuing) I’m . . . Annie, I’m pregnant.
ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.
ANAKIN
That’s . . . that’s wonderful.
PADME
What are we going to do?
ANAKIN
We’re not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.
SUPER BATTLE DROID G21
The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Good. Where is the Separatist Council?
SUPER BATTLE DROID G21
This way, sir ...
GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.
72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY A hologram of Darth Sidious appears.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Yes, Lord Sidious.
DARTH SlDIOUS
General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
It will be done, My Lord.
DARTH SlDIOUS
The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.
The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS

But the loss of Count Dooku?
DARTH SlDIOUS
His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.
73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT
PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.
ANAKIN
. . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I’ve never been so happy as I am at this moment.
PADME
Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby’s room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
ANAKIN
You are so beautiful!
PADME
It’s only because I’m so in love . . .
ANAKIN
No, it’s because I’m so in love with you.
PADME
So love has blinded you?
ANAKIN
Well, that’s not exactly what I meant . . .
PADME
But it’s probably true!
They laugh.
ANAKIN
I haven’t laughed in so long . . .
PADME
Neither have I.
74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM
The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming. PADME
Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.

She screams and dies.
75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.
PADME
Anakin??
She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.
76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.
PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn’t look at her.
PADME
What’s bothering you?
ANAKIN
Nothing . . .
ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME’S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.
PADME
Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
ANAKIN
It was a dream.
PADME
Bad?
ANAKIN
Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died. PADME
And?
ANAKIN
It was about you.
They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them. PADME

Tell me.
ANAKIN
It was only a dream.
PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath. ANAKIN
(continuing) You die in childbirth . . .
PADME
And the baby?
ANAKIN
I don’t know.
PADME
It was only a dream.
ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.
ANAKIN
. . . I won’t let this one become real, Padme.
They embrace, then part.
PADME
Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order. ANAKIN
I know ....
PADME
Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
ANAKIN
(suspicious) Have you told him anything?
PADME
No, but he’s your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
ANAKIN
He’s been a father to me, but he’s still on the Council. Don’t tell him anything!
PADME
I won’t, Anakin.
ANAKIN
I don’t need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.
77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda ‘s room, deep in thought.
YODA
Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you

have . . .
ANAKIN
They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
YODA
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
ANAKIN
Someone . . .
YODA
. . . close to you?
ANAKIN
Yes.
YODA
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
ANAKIN
I won’t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
YODA
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is. ANAKIN
What must I do, Master Yoda?
YODA
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY
ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.
79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.
OBI-WAN
You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
ANAKIN
I’m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
OBI-WAN
In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
ANAKIN

What’s wrong then?
OBI-WAN
The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
ANAKIN
Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
ANAKIN
Be careful of what?
OBI-WAN
He has requested your presence.
ANAKIN
What for?
OBI-WAN
He would not say.
ANAKIN
He didn’t inform the Jedi Council? That’s unusual, isn’t it?
OBI-WAN
All of this is unusual, and it’s making me feel uneasy. You’re probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.
ANAKIN
I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor’s power, mine also for that matter. Aren’t we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
OBI-WAN
The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.
80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-DAY
ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.
PALPATINE
Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN
The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
PALPATINE

They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
ANAKIN
I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.
PALPATINE
There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.
ANAKIN
With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.
PALPATINE
Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.
ANAKIN
Everyone will agree on that.
PALPATINE
Anakin, I’ve known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.
ANAKIN
Of course.
PALPATINE
I need your help, son.
ANAKIN
What do you mean?
PALPATINE
I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They’re shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
ANAKIN
I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.
PALPATINE
Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I’m depending on you.
ANAKIN
For what? I don’t understand.
PALPATINE

To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .
ANAKIN thinks about this.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Anakin . . . I’m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN
Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
PALPATINE
I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.
81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA’S OFFICE-DAY
PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa ‘s office.
BAIL ORGANA
Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic. FANG ZAR
When did this happen?
BAIL ORGANA
The decree was posted this morning.
PADME
Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
MON MOTHMA
Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists. GIDDEAN DANU
The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.
BAIL ORGANA
We can’t let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight. EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.
TERR TANEEL
What are you suggesting?
BAIL ORGANA
I apologize. I didn’t mean to sound like a Separatist.
MON MOTHMA
We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.
BAIL ORGANA

It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.
PADME
I can’t believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen. GlDDEAN DANU
Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.
MON MOTHMA
The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.
BAIL ORGANA
We can’t sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .
PADME
Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it’s better to leave some things unsaid.
BAIL ORGANA
Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.
MON MOTHMA
That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.
They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment. PADME
Agreed.
82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY
ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.
83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI- WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI. MACE
Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor’s personal representative.
ANAKIN

I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
ANAKIN
I understand.
MACE
You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master. Anakin reacts with anger.
ANAKIN
What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it’s unfair . . . I’m more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
MACE
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
ANAKIN
Forgive me, Master.
ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
YODA
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
OBI-WAN
It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare. MACE
We cannot take ships from the front line.
OBI-WAN
And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup. YODA
Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. Kl-ADI-MUNDI
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
MACE
It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
OBI-WAN
He’s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It’s the main

navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
ANAKIN
I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
MACE
Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
YODA
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
MACE
It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
ANAKIN is disappointed.
84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.
ANAKIN
What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That’s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It’s insulting!
OBI-WAN
Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It’s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you’re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn’t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
ANAKIN
I swear to you, I didn’t ask to be put on the Council . . .
OBI-WAN
But it’s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
ANAKIN
That has nothing to do with this.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
ANAKIN
You mean divided loyalties.
OBI-WAN
I warned you there was tension between the Council and the

Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn’t you listen? You walked right into it.
ANAKIN
The Council is upset I’m the youngest to ever serve.
OBI-WAN
No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They’re dangerous, dark thoughts. ANAKIN
Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
OBI-WAN
I hope so . . .
ANAKIN
I sense there’s more to this talk than you’re saying.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
ANAKIN
And?
OBI-WAN
Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn’t want to see you put in this situation.
ANAKIN
What situation?
OBI-WAN
(takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor’s dealings. They want to know what he’s up to.
ANAKIN
They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That’s treason!
OBI-WAN
We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
ANAKIN
Why didn’t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
OBI-WAN
This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
ANAKIN
The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He’s

watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
OBI-WAN
That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
ANAKIN
Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
OBI-WAN
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. ANAKIN
You’re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That’s what’s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
OBI-WAN
The Council is asking you.
85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
A JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.
86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY
YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.
OBI-WAN
Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
YODA
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
MACE
It’s very dangerous, putting them together. I don’t think the boy can handle it. I don’t trust him.
OBI-WAN
He’ll be all right. I trust him with my life.
MACE
I wish I did.
OBI-WAN
With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
MACE
So the prophecy says.
YODA
A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
OBI-WAN

He will not let me down. He never has.
YODA
I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.
87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDA- SUNSET
Padme’s Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO. PADME
Thank you, Captain.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
Rest well. My Lady.
CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.
PADME
I’ll be up in a while.
MOTEE
Yes, my lady.
C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit. C-3PO
Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
PADME
Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
The golden droid turns and exits.
PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.
ANAKIN
Beautiful, isn’t it?
PADME jumps and turns around.
PADME
You startled me.
He sits next to her on the bench.
ANAKIN

How are you feeling? PADME
He keeps kicking. ANAKIN
He?! Why do you think it’s a boy? PADME
(laughs) My motherly intuition. She puts his hand on her belly. ANAKIN
Whoa! With a kick that strong, it’s got to be a girl.
They laugh.
PADME
I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I’m so proud of you. ANAKIN
I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
PADME
Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
ANAKIN
They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that’s the problem.
PADME
Anakin . . .
ANAKIN
Sometimes, I wonder what’s happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
PADME
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? ANAKIN
(suspicious) What do you mean?
PADME
What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
ANAKIN
I don’t believe that. And you’re sounding like a Separatist!
PADME
Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you’re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

ANAKIN
(growing angry) Don’t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I’m not your errand boy. I’m not anyone’s errand boy!
PADME
What is it?
ANAKIN
Nothing.
PADME
Don’t do this . . . don’t shut me out. Let me help you.
ANAKIN
You can’t help me . . . I’m trying to help you.
They look in each other’s eyes.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me. PADME is startled at this.
PADME
I sense there are things you are not telling me.
PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.
PADME
(continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT
ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine’s box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing “Squid Lake.”
ANAKIN
You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
PALPATINE
Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
ANAKIN
At last, we’ll be able to capture that monster and end this war. PALPATINE
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn’t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far ... but,

they can’t always be trusted to do the right thing. ANAKIN
They try.
PALPATINE
Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.
ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him. PALPATINE
(continuing) Anakin, you know I’m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven’t included you in their plot, they soon will.
ANAKIN
I’m not sure I understand.
PALPATINE
You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they’re planning to betray me. ANAKIN
I don’t think . . .
PALPATINE
Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don’t you?
ANAKIN
I know they don’t trust you . . .
PALPATINE
Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter. ANAKIN
I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
PALPATINE
Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn’t they?
ANAKIN doesn’t say anything. He simply looks down.
PALPATINE
(continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn’t they?
ANAKIN
I don’t know ... I don’t know what to say.
PALPATINE
Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. “All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.” Even the Jedi.
ANAKIN
The Jedi use their power for good.
PALPATINE
Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and

justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . . ANAKIN
. . . evil.
PALPATINE
. . . from a Jedi’s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
ANAKIN
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
PALPATINE
And the Jedi don’t?
ANAKIN
The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
PALPATINE smiles.
PALPATINE
Or so you’ve been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
ANAKIN
I’m not sure it’s wrong.
PALPATINE
Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
ANAKIN is deep in thought.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis “the wise”?
ANAKIN
No.
PALPATINE
I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
ANAKIN
He could actually save people from death?

PALPATINE
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
ANAKIN
What happened to him?
PALPATINE
He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It’s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
ANAKIN
Is it possible to learn this power?
PALPATINE
Not from a Jedi.
89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY
A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.
90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY
YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
(holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.
MACE
(holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
ANAKIN
A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
YODA
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
OBI-WAN
Does everyone agree?
All the JEDI concur.
ANAKIN
The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.

They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.
MACE
(a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
Yes, this decision is ours to make.
ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.
YODA
A Master is needed, with more experience.
MACE
Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
ANAKIN
He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.
ANAKIN
(continuing) No offense, my Master, but I’m only stating a fact. OBI-WAN
Oh no, you’re quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
YODA
Obi-Wan, my choice is.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
YODA
I agree.
All the JEDI concur.
MACE
Very well. Council is adjourned.
ANAKIN is angry.
MACE
(continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there’s no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.
91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY
YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform. CLONE COMMANDER GREE
The droids have started up their main power generators.
YODA
Then now the time is, Commander.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE
Yes, sir.
The battle begins.
92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY
A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.
93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING Padme’s apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.
94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM- EARLY MORNING
PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches. OBI-WAN
Has Anakin been to see you?
PADME
Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
OBI-WAN
I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.
They laugh.
PADME
You’re not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn’t it? OBI-WAN
You should be a Jedi, Padme.
PADME
You’re not very good at hiding your feelings.
OBI-WAN
It’s Anakin . . . He’s becoming moody and detached. He’s been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor’s representative . . . but I think it’s more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
PADME
Why would he talk to me about his work?
OBI-WAN studies her.

OBI-WAN
Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
PADME
Don’t give me that look.
OBI-WAN
I know how he feels about you.
PADME
(nervous) What did he say?
OBI-WAN
Nothing. He didn’t have to.
PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.
PADME
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
OBI-WAN
I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I’m worried about him.
PADME looks down and doesn’t answer.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He’s changed considerably since we returned . . .
They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI- WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city. OBI-WAN
(continuing) Padme, I’m not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn’t upset you. We’re all friends, I care about both of you . . . PADME
Thank you, Obi-Wan.
OBI-WAN
Please do what you can to help him.
95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-DAY
PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme’s living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.
PADME
We cannot let this turn into another war.
BAIL ORGANA
Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.
MON MOTHMA
We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the

Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that’s all. PADME
I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
BANA BREEMU
That would be dangerous.
MON MOTHMA
We don’t know where the Jedi stand in all this.
PADME
I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
GiDDEAN DANU
Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky. PADME
The Jedi aren’t any happier with the situation than we are . . .
CHI EEKWAY
Patience, Senator.
FANG ZAR
We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.
BANA BREEMU
When you present the “petition of the two thousand” to the Chancellor, things may change.
BAIL ORGANA
Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.
PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.
96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.
ANAKIN
You’re going to need me on this one, Master.
OBI-WAN
Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase. OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.
ANAKIN
Master!
OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.
ANAKIN
(continuing) Master, I’ve disappointed you. I have not been very

appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I’ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
OBI-WAN
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won’t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.
OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) Don’t worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I’ll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
ANAKIN
Well, there’s always a first time.
OBI-WAN laughs.
They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN
Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser. 97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.
98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE
CLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.
OBI-WAN
I’ll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don’t take too long. CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?

They laugh.
OBI-WAN
(laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
OBI-WAN
Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
I’m counting on you.
99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE
OBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau. 100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR’S TRANSPORT-DAY
The Chancellor’s Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him. PALPATINE
Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
ANAKIN
He will soon have Grievous’s head.
PALPATINE
We can only hope the Council didn’t make a mistake.
ANAKIN
The Council was very sure in its decision.
They exit the landing platform.
101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY
They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.
JAR JAR
Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
The Gungan waves to Anakin.
ANAKIN

Hi, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR
Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.
Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.
PALPATINE
There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
ANAKIN
Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
PALPATINE
They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
ANAKIN
That’s ridiculous. Who?!?
PALPATINE
(slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator. ANAKIN
That’s impossible. I would know.
PALPATINE
Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
ANAKIN becomes worried.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I’m sure your Master will do fine.
102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM
PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.
OBI-WAN
Save your energy.
PADME
I can’t!
OBI-WAN
Don’t give up, Padme. Don’t give up . . .
103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM- DAY
ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him. ANAKIN
I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan’s been here, hasn’t he? PADME

He came by this morning.
ANAKIN
What did he want?
PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense. PADME
He’s worried about you.
ANAKIN
You told him about us, didn’t you?
She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.
PADME
He’s your best friend, Anakin. He says you’re under a lot of stress. ANAKIN
And he’s not?
PADME
You have been moody lately.
ANAKIN
I’m not moody . . .
PADME
Anakin! Don’t do this again.
ANAKIN
I don’t know ... I feel . . . lost.
PADME
Lost? What do you mean? You’re always so sure of yourself. I don’t understand.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan and the Council don’t trust me.
PADME
They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son. ANAKIN
Something’s happening . . . I’m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I’m not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn’t.
PADME
You expect too much of yourself.
They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.
ANAKIN
I have found a way to save you.
PADME
Save me?

ANAKIN
From my nightmares.
PADME
Is that what’s bothering you?
ANAKIN
I won’t lose you, Padme.
PADME
I’m not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
ANAKIN
No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying. PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.
PADME
You don’t need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
They embrace and kiss.
104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE
OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER’s hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet’s surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.
105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.
TlON MEDON
Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary? OBI-WAN
Unfortunately, the war.
TlON MEDON
There is no war here unless you’ve brought it with you.
OBI-WAN
With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan’s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.
TlON MEDON
He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.

OBI-WAN
I understand.
TlON MEDON
The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
OBI-WAN
Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time. OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:
OBI-WAN
(continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I’m staying here. Tell Cody I’ve made contact.
The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.
106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY
On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.
TlON MEDON
I told you, all he wanted was fuel.
BODYGUARD
What was his name?
TlON MEDON
He didn’t say.
They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.
107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.
108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY
OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It’s hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.
109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY
OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON- LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around. OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his

slight hand movements. OBI-WAN
I need transportation. WRANGLER
(subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation. OBI-WAN
Get it for me.
WRANGLER
(subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.
One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.
OBI-WAN
This one.
The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.
WRANGLER
Boga. She answers to Boga.
OBI-WAN
Good girl, Boga.
OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.
110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY
The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.
111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
It won’t be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
NUTE GUNRAY
Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us

safe.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.
OBI-WAN is deep in thought.
112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL. OBI-WAN
Hello, there!
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you’re doomed, (to droids) Kill him!
About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
They stare at each other for a moment.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Enough of this.
The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi’s lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
OBI-WAN
Your move.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.
OBI-WAN
You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly

onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS’s hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.
OBI-WAN
I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
OBI-WAN
I don’t think so.
TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard’s electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him. 113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.
114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga. 115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET
The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.
116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-SUNSET PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators
NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE. PALPATINE

I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
PADME
May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
PALPATINE
I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . . PADME
You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
PALPATINE
You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.
FANG ZAR
But surely . . .
The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.
PALPATINE
I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
PADME
On behalf of the “delegation of two thousand,” I thank you, Chancellor.
PALPATINE
I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.
PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
ANAKIN
What do you mean?
PALPATINE
They are not to be trusted.
ANAKIN
Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
PALPATINE
These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.

ANAKIN
I’m sure you’re mistaken.
PALPATINE
I’m surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things. ANAKIN
I simply don’t sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look. PALPATINE
Yes, you do, but you don’t seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.
117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
MACE WlNDU
Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
ANAKIN
Yes, Master.
ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY’s hologram disappears.
MACE WINDU
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.
MACE WINDU
That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . . Kl-ADI-MUNDI
. . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
YODA
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN
Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.
PALPATINE
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
ANAKIN
I should be there with him.
PALPATINE
It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn’t seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don’t you wonder why they won’t make you a Jedi Master?
ANAKIN
I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
PALPATINE
They don’t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
They walk into the hallway.
ANAKIN
How do you know the ways of the Force?
PALPATINE
My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
They stop.
ANAKIN
You know the dark side?!?
PALPATINE
Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
ANAKIN
I won’t be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family. PALPATINE
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able

to save your wife from certain death. ANAKIN
What did you say?
PALPATINE
Use my knowledge, I beg you . . . ANAKIN
You’re a Sith Lord!
ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber. PALPATINE
I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don’t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I’ve known you, you’ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
ANAKIN
You’re wrong!
PALPATINE
Are you going to kill me?
ANAKIN
I would certainly like to.
PALPATINE
I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE’s throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.
ANAKIN
I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
PALPATINE
Of course you should. But you’re not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic? ANAKIN
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
PALPATINE
You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.
ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.
PALPATINE
(continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you’ll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the

good of all . . .
PALPATINE sits behind his desk.
119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find. 120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY
A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.
OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan’s LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.
121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY
GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan’s access to the General. Obi-Wan’s LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan’s LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.
122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY
GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving

onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid’s electronic staff.
123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.
OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General’s scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General’s electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.
OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form’s guts encased in a bag in the Droid’s chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid’s laser pistol.
The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass. OBI-WAN
So uncivilized . . .
OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.
124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR’s

office. ANAKIN enters the hangar. ANAKIN
Master Windu, I must talk to you. MACE WINDU
What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
ANAKIN
He won’t give up his power. I’ve just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU
A Sith Lord?
ANAKIN
Yes. The one we have been looking for.
MACE WINDU
How do you know this?
ANAKIN
He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
MACE WINDU
Are you sure?
ANAKIN
Absolutely.
MACE WINDU
Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
ANAKIN
Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
MACE WINDU
For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
ANAKIN
I must go, Master.
MACE WINDU
No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
ANAKIN

Yes, Master.
MACE WINDU
Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
ANAKIN
Yes, Master.
ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.
125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME’S APARTMENT- EARLY EVENING
(INTERCUT)
PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.
PALPATINE
(V.O.) You do know, don’t you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
PADME
I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
C-3PO
My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
ANAKIN
I can’t do this ... I can’t let her die.
ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.
126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING
The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.
FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.
127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE- EARLY EVENING
The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor’s aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor’s office.
128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.
PALPATINE
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you’re here sooner than expected.

MACE WINDU
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers. PALPATINE
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
MACE
The Senate will decide your fate.
PALPATINE
(burst of anger) I am the Senate!
MACE
Not yet!
PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.
PALPATINE
It’s treason, then.
A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.
Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.
ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor’s office.
In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor’s desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.
They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.
MACE WINDU
You are under arrest, My Lord.
PALPATINE
Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.
MACE WlNDU
You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . . PALPATINE

No! No! You will die!
PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE’s lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.
PALPATINE
He is a traitor, Anakin.
MACE WlNDU
He’s the traitor. Stop him!
PALPATINE
Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.
MACE WlNDU
Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
PALPATINE
You are not one of them, Anakin. Don’t let him kill me.
MACE WlNDU
Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
PALPATINE
I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.
MACE WlNDU
Don’t listen to him, Anakin.
PALPATINE
Help me! Don’t let him kill me. I can’t hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .
MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine’s hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor’s face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.
PALPATINE
I can’t ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don’t kill me. I give up. I’m dying. I can’t hold on any longer.
MACE WlNDU
You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
ANAKIN
You can’t kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
MACE WlNDU
He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.
PALPATINE

I’m too weak. Don’t kill me. Please.
ANAKIN
It is not the Jedi way . . .
MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR. ANAKIN
(continuing) He must live . . . PALPATINE
Please don’t, please don’t . . . ANAKIN
I need him . . . PALPATINE Please don’t . . . ANAKIN
NO!!!
Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi’s hand holding the lightsaber.
As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life. The full force of Palpatine’s powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.
PALPATINE
Power! Unlimited power!
His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.
ANAKIN
What have I done?
ANAKIN sits.
PALPATINE
You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
ANAKIN
I will do whatever you ask.
PALPATINE
Good.
ANAKIN
Just help me save Padme’s life. I can’t live without her. I won’t let her die. I want the power to stop death.
PALPATINE

To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.
ANAKIN
I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith. PALPATINE
Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader. ANAKIN
Thank you. my Master.
PALPATINE
Rise, Darth Vader.
Palpatine moves over to his desk.
129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY
YODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.
130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EVENING PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak. He is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.
PALPATINE
Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
ANAKIN
I agree. The Jedi’s next move will be against the Senate. PALPATINE
Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don’t you?
ANAKIN
I understand, Master.
PALPATINE
We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
ANAKIN
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
PALPATINE

Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT
ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers. 132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY
The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY. OBI-WAN
Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Very good, sir.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
(continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you’ll be needing this.
He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up. OBI-WAN
Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let’s get a move on. We’ve got a battle to win here.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Yes, sir!
OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. CLONE COMMANDER CODY
It will be done, My Lord.
The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Blast him!
The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS

as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.
OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.
133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN
The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI- ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Commander 1138 . . .
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA
Yes, sir.
DARTH SlDIOUS
The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA
It will be done, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI- MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He’s killed before he can defend himself.
134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY
A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.
AAYLA
Steady. . . . steady . . .
They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.
AAYLA
(continuing) Bly, do you think they’re Droids?
BLY

No.
BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.
Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.
135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY
YODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall.
136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY
The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.
The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES.
The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION.
137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY
The CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS. DARTH SIDIOUS
Execute Order Sixty-Six.
CLONE PILOT
It will be done, My Lord.
138 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY
PLO KOON heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform. PLO KOON
There they are. Land on the nearest platform.

The FOUR CLONE PILOTS with PLO KOON drop back and blast him out of the sky.
140 EXT. SALEUCAMI-FOREST
Three Speeder Bikes race through the forest. A Jedi, STASS ALLIE is in the lead. The TWO CLONES following her drop back and blast her, causing her to crash in a huge EXPLOSION.
141 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-NIGHT
DARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM

OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him. CLONE COMMANDER GREE
Yes, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS
The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY
A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank- like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink. CLONE COMMANDER GREE
It will be done, My Lord.
CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.
YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.
But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.
143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT
A JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS. 144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT
ANAKIN walks through the Jedi Temple, where he finds and kills SHAAK TI.
He exits Shaak Ti’s room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place.
145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT
ANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner. YOUNGLINGS
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?
ANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.

146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN C-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.
C-3PO
The Chancellor’s office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don’t worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right. PADME bursts into tears.
147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN
The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA’s Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.
148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE- DAWN
The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.
BAIL ORGANA
What’s going on here?!?
CLONE SERGEANT
There’s been a rebellion. Don’t worry, sir, the situation is under control.
The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.
CLONE SERGEANT
(continuing) I’m sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.
The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.
CLONE SERGEANT
(continuing) It’s time for you to leave, sir.
BAIL ORGANA
And so it is.
BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.
CLONE COMMANDER APPO
Get him! Shoot him!
SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser pistol.

The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.
The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.
149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN
BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.
150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY
The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.
151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY
OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.
OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI- WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.
The NOS MONSTER’S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.
The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.
152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK
CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST’s and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT- ST’s spots something floating in the water. It is what’s left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is

lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.
AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT
Everyone out of there!
A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.
CREATURE
Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)
CLONE SERGEANT
Did you find something?
CREATURE
It’s nothing, nothing. (laughs)
CLONE SERGEANT
It’s nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east. CLONE TROOPER
Yes, sir.
Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.
CREATURE
Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.
TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.
YODA
Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.
YODA
(continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . . YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN- CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect’s back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.
153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK
The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.

The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.
YODA
Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.
154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING- UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.
ROYAL GUARD
Identification . . .
BAIL ORGANA
Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.
BAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.
155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING- UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.
156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY
BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.
BAIL ORGANA
Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?
CAPTAIN ANTILLES
Yes, sir. We’ve encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.
BAIL ORGANA
That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Did you find Kenobi?
CLONE TROOPER

No one could have survived that fall. He watches them pass.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Start loading your men on the ship. CLONE TROOPER
Yes, sir.
OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.
158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous’s secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.
159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE
OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous’s tiny Starfighter.
160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS’S STARFIGHTER-SPACE OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.
OBI-WAN
Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .
A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.
BAIL
(hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I’ve locked on. Repeat.
The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.
BAIL ORGANA
Master Kenobi??
OBI-WAN
Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help. BAIL ORGANA
We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We’re sending you our coordinates.
161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.
C-3PO
My Lady, there’s a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.
PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.
162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE- DAWN
THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN’s ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.
THREEPIO
Hush! Not so loud!
PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.
PADME
Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
ANAKIN
I’m fine. I’m fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe. PADME
Captain Typho’s here, we’re safe. What’s happening?
C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.
C-3PO
What is going on?
ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.
C-3PO
(continuing) You can’t be anymore confused than I am.
ANAKIN
The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
PADME
I can’t believe that!
ANAKIN
I couldn’t either at first, but it’s true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.
C-3PO
Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.
ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.

C-3PO
(continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.
ARTOO BEEPS quietly.
C-3PO
(continuing) Whatever it is, we’ll be the last to know.
PADME
Anakin, what are you going to do?
ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme. ANAKIN
I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.
PADME
What about Obi-Wan?
ANAKIN
I don’t know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he’s remained loyal to the Chancellor.
PADME
How could this have happened?
ANAKIN
The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren’t the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.
PADME
What are you saying?
ANAKIN
You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over. PADME
What if they start an inquisition? I’ve opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
ANAKIN
That won’t happen. I won’t let it.
PADME
Oh, Anakin, I’m afraid.
ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.
ANAKIN
Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have

gathered in the Mustafar system. I’m going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.
They kiss.
ANAKIN
(continuing) Please, wait for me.
PADME
I will.
ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away. C-3PO
(to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. ARTOO beeps.
C-3PO
(continuing) Take care, my little friend.
ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her. C-3PO
(continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?
PADME
No thank you, Threepio.
G-3PO
A snack, perhaps?
PADME
No.
THREEPIO starts to move off.
C-3PO
I feel so helpless.
163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE
OBI-WAN’s ship docks with Bail Organa’s Starcruiser.
164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY
The door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.
BAIL ORGANA
You made it.
YODA
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is. OBI-WAN
You were attacked by your Clones, also?
YODA
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.

OBI-WAN
How many other Jedi managed to survive?
YODA
Heard from no one, have we.
BAIL ORGANA
I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That’s why I went looking for Yoda.
OBI-WAN
Have we had any contact from the Temple?
YODA
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
BAIL ORGANA
It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over ...
OBI-WAN
Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
BAIL ORGANA
It’s too dangerous to return.
YODA
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
OBI-WAN
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
YODA
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY
Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.
166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.
NUTE GUNRAY
The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS
You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.
The hologram disappears.

167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT
The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.
PILOT
We are receiving a message from the Chancellor’s office, sir.
BAIL ORGANA
Send it through.
PILOT
Yes, sir.
The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen. MAS AMEDDA
Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
BAIL ORGANA
Tell the Chancellor I will be there.
MAS AMEDDA
Very well. He will be expecting you.
MAS AMEDDA’s image disappears from the screen.
BAIL ORGANA
It could be a trap.
OBI-WAN
No, I don’t think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
YODA
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.
GUARD
Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?
BAIL ORGANA
Certainly.
GUARD
Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi. OBI-WAN
It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.
GUARD
It would be better if they stayed with you.
BAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head

for the Jedi Temple.
169 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE
ANAKIN’s Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.
170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
ANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.
ANAKIN
Artoo . . . stay with the ship.
ARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship. 171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
ANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.
172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
ANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.
NUTE GUNRAY
Welcome, Lord Vader. We’ve been expecting you.
Everyone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.
173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY
Smoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.
174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY
A DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.
OBI-WAN
There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
YODA
Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET
The awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.
176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

The Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.
PALPATINE
. . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
BAIL ORGANA
I was held up. What’s happening?
PADME
The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
BAIL ORGANA
That’s not true!
PADME
He’s been presenting evidence all afternoon.
BAIL ORGANA
And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do. PALPATINE
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. (applause)
These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.
177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET
YODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.
YODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.
OBI-WAN
Not even the younglings survived.
YODA
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was. OBI-WAN
. . .Who?? Who could have done this?
178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.

ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.
Then POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.
179 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET
PALPATINE
The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. (applause)
180 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
In the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow. 181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET
PALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.
PALPATINE
The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.
There is a long period of APPLAUSE.
PADME
Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.
PALPATINE
In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.
PALPATINE
(continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .
The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.
PALPATINE
(continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .
The Senate APPLAUDS.
PADME
So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .

BAIL ORGANA
We cannot let this happen.
He starts to stand up. PADME stops him.
PADME
Not now! There will be a time.
182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY
After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.
RUNE HAAKO
Stop! Enough, this is not right!
RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.
183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.
NUTE GUNRAY
The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want... NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.
184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.
OBI-WAN
I’ve recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away. YODA
Good... For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.
OBI-WAN
Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .
YODA

If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find. OBI-WAN
I must know the truth, Master.
OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) It can’t be . . . It can’t be . . .
As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him. ANAKIN
The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
ANAKIN
Yes, My Master.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.
OBI-WAN
I can’t watch any more.
OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.
YODA
Destroy the Sith, we must.
OBI-WAN
Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
YODA
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
OBI-WAN
He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
YODA
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
OBI-WAN
How could it have come to this?
YODA
To question, no time there is.
OBI-WAN

I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don’t know where to look.
YODA
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN
May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.
186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON
A DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme’s apartment.
187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDA- AFTERNOON
The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.
C-3PO
Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it’s you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.
The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.
OBI-WAN
Has Anakin been here . . . ?
C-3PO
Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves. PADME
Master Kenobi . . .
She embraces Obi-Wan.
PADME
(continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you’re alive. OBI-WAN
The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . . PADME
I know, it’s hard to believe everything to which we’ve dedicated our lives is gone.
OBI-WAN
I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making. PADME

The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
OBI-WAN
No. Padme . . . It’s over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
PADME
The Sith!?!
OBI-WAN
I’m here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him? PADME
Yesterday.
OBI-WAN
And do you know where he is now?
PADME
(looks down) No.
OBI-WAN
Padme, I need your help. He’s in grave danger.
PADME
From the Sith?
OBI-WAN
From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side. PADME
You’re wrong! How could you even say that?
OBI-WAN
I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
PADME
Not Anakin! He couldn’t!
OBI-WAN
He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we’ve been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
PADME
I don’t believe you ... I can’t.
OBI-WAN
Padme, I must find him.
PADME
You’re going to kill him, aren’t you?
OBI-WAN
He has become a very great threat.
As PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.

PADME
I can’t . . .
OBI-WAN
Anakin is the father, isn’t he?
PADME looks away.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I’m so sorry.
OBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.
188 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
R2-D2 waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter. 189 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
ANAKIN surveys the slaughter with a crazed look in his eyes.
190 INT. MUSTAFAR-CONTROL CENTER-BALCONY-DAY
ANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room balcony.
191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET
A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
My Lady, let me come with you.
PADME
There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal. TYPHO bows.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
PADME
I’ll be all right, Captain.
He goes to the speeder and gets in.
PADME
(continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
C-3PO
Oh, dear.
TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF

takes off.
192 INT. NABOO SKIFF
THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.
C-3PO
Green light. Do you know that I think I’m beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
OBI-WAN stows away on Padme’s ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.
193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR’S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET
A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.
DARTH VADER
The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.
DARTH SlDIOUS
It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.
DARTH VADER
Thank you, My Master.
194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY
A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.
DARTH VADER
Very good, My Lord.
ANAKIN sees Padme’s ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.
195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin’s GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.
ANAKIN
Padme, I saw your ship . . .
They embrace.
PADME
Oh, Anakin!

ANAKIN
It’s all right, you’re safe now. What are you doing out here?
PADME
I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
ANAKIN
What things?
PADME
He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
PADME
He cares about us.
ANAKIN
Us??!
PADME
He knows . . . He wants to help you.
ANAKIN
Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can’t ... he can’t help you. He’s not strong enough.
PADME
Anakin, all I want is your love.
ANAKIN
Love won’t save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that. PADME
At what cost? You are a good person. Don’t do this.
ANAKIN
I won’t lose you the way I lost my mother! I’ve become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I’ve done it for you. To protect you.
PADME
Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
ANAKIN
Don’t you see, we don’t have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
PADME
I don’t believe what I’m hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You’ve

changed.
ANAKIN
I don’t want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don’t you turn against me.
PADME
I don’t know you anymore. Anakin, you’re breaking my heart. I’ll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can’t follow.
ANAKIN
Because of Obi-Wan?
PADME
Because of what you’ve done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
ANAKIN
(seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!
PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.
PADME
No!
ANAKIN
You’re with him. You’ve betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
PADME
NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.
OBI-WAN
Let her go, Anakin.
ANAKIN
What have you and she been up to?
OBI-WAN
Let her go!
ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.
ANAKIN
You turned her against me.
OBI-WAN
You have done that yourself.
ANAKIN
You will not take her from me.
ANAKIN throws off his cloak.

OBI-WAN
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.
ANAKIN
Don’t lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
OBI-WAN
Your new Empire?
ANAKIN
Don’t make me kill you.
OBI-WAN
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
ANAKIN
If you’re not with me, you’re my enemy.
OBI-WAN
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must. (ignites his lightsaber)
ANAKIN
You will try.
ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.
ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force. They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.
ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME’s aid.
196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR’S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT
YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS’s desk. YODA

I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Master Yoda, you survived.
YODA
Surprised?
DARTH SlDIOUS
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.
YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.
197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER- DAY
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI- WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.
198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER- DAY
R2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO pokes his head out of the ship’s doorway.
C-3PO
What are you doing? You’re going to hurt her. Wait!!
C-3PO starts down the ramp.
199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR’S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT
MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.
DARTH SlDIOUS
I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
YODA
Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.
YODA
(continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward

the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.
YODA
(continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??
YODA ignites his lightsaber.
DARTH SlDIOUS
You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.
YODA
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.
200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.
ANAKIN
Don’t make me destroy you, Master. You’re no match for the dark side.
OBI-WAN
I’ve heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I’d hear it from you.
ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN’s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.
201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT PALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor’s Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space.
202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
The battle intensifies.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.
OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.

ANAKIN
You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.
Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels. They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI- WAN away.
They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.
203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord’s lightning bolts.
The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.
YODA
Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy. YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another. YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.
YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.
204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.
The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.
ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control

panel.
ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.
205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY
ANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting.
206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.
207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT
YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.
YODA
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
BAIL ORGANA
(in speeder) There aren’t many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you’re ready.
208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda ‘s body.
CLONE COMMANDER THIRE
There is no sign of his body, sir.
MAS AMEDDA
Then he is not dead.
PALPATINE
Double your search.
CLONE COMMANDER THIRE
Yes sir. Right away, sir.
PALPATINE

(to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.
MAS AMEDDA
Yes, Master.
PALPATINE
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.
209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It’s raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.
It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.
210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT
BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.
211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA’S SPEEDER-NIGHT
YODA straightens himself out.
YODA
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.
212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.
213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY C-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.
C-3PO
I am being careful. I’ve got a good hold on her, but . . . I’m worried about my back. I hope it’s able to hold up under this weight.
C-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.
214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.
SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI- WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.
OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.
ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.
OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin’s DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.
OBI-WAN
I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river. ANAKIN
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
OBI-WAN
From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
ANAKIN
From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

OBI-WAN
Well, then you are lost!
ANAKIN
This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN’s platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.
OBI-WAN
It’s over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
ANAKIN
You underestimate my power!
OBI-WAN
Don’t try it.
ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.
ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
OBI-WAN picks up Anakin’s light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.
ANAKIN
I hate you!
OBI-WAN
You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.
ANAKIN’S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.
215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY
OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can’t watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.
He runs back to Padme’s ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.
216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme.

THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.
C-3PO
Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.
OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.
217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.
PADME
Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.
OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot’s station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.
218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY
ANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.
219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE- DAY
An Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS.
220 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY
DARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.
221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY
DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.
DARTH SIDIOUS
Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He’s still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Yes sir. Right away.
Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN’s forehead.
222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT
On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.
YODA
Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...

QUI -GON
(V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
YODA
Eternal consciousness.
QUI-GON
(V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
YODA
. . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
QUI-GON
(V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
YODA
A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.
BAIL ORGANA
Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.
224 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT
OBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI- WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.
BAIL ORGANA
We’ll take her to the medical center, quickly.
225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

The shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN’s body is carried along in a floating medical capsule.
226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT
POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.
MEDICAL DROID
Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can’t explain, we are losing her.
OBI-WAN
She’s dying?
MEDICAL DROID
We don’t know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
BAIL ORGANA
Babies??!!
MEDICAL DROID
She’s carrying twins.
YODA
Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.
C-3PO
It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY
ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.
228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT
The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.
OBI-WAN
Don’t give up, Padme.
PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY .
MEDICAL DROID
It’s a boy.
PADME

Luke . . .
PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.
MEDICAL DROID
... and a girl.
PADME
. . . Leia.
R2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.
229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY
VADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.
230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT
OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.
OBI-WAN
You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.
PADME
I can’t . . .
PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN’s hand. She is holding Anakin’s japor snippet.
OBI-WAN
Save your energy.
PADME
Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.
231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY
DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord. MEDICAL DROID
My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.
DARTH SIDIOUS
Good. Good.
The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.
DARTH SIDIOUS
(continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?
DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the

frame until he is in a CLOSEUP. DARTH VADER
Yes, My Master.
DARTH VADER looks around the room. DARTH VADER
(continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?
DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.
DARTH SIDIOUS
I’m afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.
A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader’s mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS. DARTH VADER
I couldn’t have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It’s impossible! No!!!
VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren’t so lucky. VADER’S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.
232 EXT. NABOO-ALDERAAN STARCRUISER
BAIL ORGANA’s Starcruiser approaches the city of Theed.
233 INT. ALDERAAN CRUISER-CONFERENCE ROOM
BAIL ORGANA, YODA, and OBI-WAN sit around a conference table. YODA
Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
OBI-WAN
We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
YODA
Split up, they should be.
BAIL ORGANA
My wife and I will take the girl. We’ve always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
OBI-WAN
And what of the boy?
YODA
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
OBI-WAN
I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin’s twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?

YODA
Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.
BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.
YODA
(continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
OBI-WAN
Training??
YODA
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
OBI-WAN
Who?
YODA
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
OBI-WAN
Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
YODA
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
OBI-WAN
I will be able to talk with him?
YODA
How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps. 234 INT. ALDERAAN STARCRUISER-HALLWAY- SPACE
BAIL ORGANA, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO, approaches CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO CREW MEMBERS.
BAIL ORGANA
Captain Antilles.

They talk for a moment, and OBI-WAN turns the baby over to the young homesteader. AUNT BERU walks to UNCLE OWEN who is standing on the ridge near the homestead. OBI-WAN leaves as OWEN, BERU, and the BABY watch the twin suns set.
END TITLES.
